### Summary:

2941	Reduce the transaction level; rollback when level reaches 0.
2942	Update the identity of a record after a record commit.

### Steps:
1. The method `updateIdentityAfterRecordCommit` updates the identity of a record in a database.
2. It takes two parameters: `oldRid` and `newRid`, representing the old and new identities of the record.
3. If the old and new identities are the same, the method returns immediately.
4. It identifies and reinserts potentially affected index keys to keep the index changes consistent.
5. The method updates the record's identity and reinserts the index keys.
6. Finally, it updates the indexes to reflect the change in record identity.

### Purpose:

It then writes a header and the number of changed types using a DataOutputStream. A simultaneous executor is used to calculate the delta for each type state concurrently. After awaiting the completion of the executor, it writes the schema, number of shards, and delta data for each changed type state to the output stream, finally flushing the stream.

### Explanation:

The method `writeVInt` takes a `OutputStream` and a 32-bit integer as input. It encodes the integer into a byte sequence using a custom format where the most significant bits are encoded first using a modified base-128 encoding scheme. Each byte is marked with a continuation bit to indicate if more bytes follow. This allows the method to represent a 32-bit integer within a variable-length sequence.

### Example 2:
 Input:
public static boolean verify(byte[] data, String signature, PublicKey publicKey) {
    try {
        Signature sig = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
        sig.initVerify(publicKey);
        sig.update(data);
        return sig.verify(java.util.Base64.getDecoder().decode(signature));
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeyException | SignatureException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to verify signature", e);
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function 'verify' is designed to check the authenticity of digital signatures.
# Step 2: It takes three parameters: data (the original content), signature (the digital signature), and publicKey (the public key of the signer).
# Step 3: The function uses `Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA")` to create a SIG object based on SHA-256 and RSA.
# Step 4: It initializes the SIG object with the public key and updates it with the original data.
# Step 5: The function then decodes the base64 encoded signature and verifies it using the `verify` method of the SIG object.

- The `process()` method accepts a `String` parameter `content`.

- The script is evaluated using a synchronized block with `engineInitializer.get().eval()`.
- If a `ScriptException` occurs during evaluation, it is caught and rethrown as a `WroRuntimeException` with the message from the original exception.

### Response:
What is the method doing?

The method `loadWebSheet` is designed to process a workbook from a binary stream (`InputStream`) using a web sheet loader. It encapsulates this functionality by delegating the loading process to the inner `getWebSheetLoader` method of the helper instance. The method subsequently returns the outcome of this loader operation, which is presumably an integer or another type indicating success or failure.

a) Does this method take any input parameters? If so, what are they? b) What does the method do with the input parameters? c) What is the output of the method?

# Step 4: The function's purpose is to validate and map command-line arguments to an object of type `O`.
# Step 5: Since the function involves class types and can throw exceptions, appropriate annotations like `@param`, `@return`, `@throws` should be used.
# Step 6: The final summary should focus on the core functionality and include necessary annotations.
