### Example 4:
 Input:
public boolean isPrime(int number) {
    if (number <= 1) return false;

    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) return false;
    }

    return true;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isPrime' and takes one parameter: an integer 'number'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, indicating whether the number is prime.
# Step 3: It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns false.
# Step 4: It then iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any of these values.
# Step 5: If divisible, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to determine if a given number is prime.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief sentence.

Output:
Check if a number is prime.

## Example 5:
Input:
public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.length() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) {
            right--;
        }
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function 'isPalindrome' checks if a given string 's' is a palindrome.
# Step 2: It uses two pointers, 'left' starting at the beginning and 'right' at the end of the string.
# Step 3: The pointers move towards each other until they meet in the middle.
# Step 4: It skips non-letter and non-digit characters.
# Step 5: If characters at the 'left' and 'right' pointers do not match (case-insensitive), it returns false.
# Step 6: If all corresponding characters match, it returns true.
# Step 7: The function's purpose is to determine if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.

 Input:
public static SnowflakeJsonRecordWriter getWriter(String url, String user, String pwd, String schema, String stage, String pipe.) throws IOException {
    return getWriter(url, user, pwd, schema, stage, pipe, (Map<String, String>) null);
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'getWriter' and takes six parameters: url, user, pwd, schema, stage, and pipe.
# Step 2: It calls another method 'getWriter' with seven parameters and the last parameter being null.
# Step 3: The function's purpose is to create a SnowflakeJsonRecordWriter with default parameters.
# Step 4: Since it calls another method with a default value, no additional tags are necessary.
# Step 5: The final summary will be a short and concise sentence.

### Example 5:
Input:
public boolean isInPath(String path, String pattern) {
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile(pattern, Pattern.DOTALL);
        Matcher m = p.matcher(path);
        return m.find();
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The method is named `isInPath` and takes two parameters: `path` (a String) and `pattern` (a String).
# Step 2: The method returns a boolean indicating whether the `path` matches the `pattern`.
# Step 3: Inside the method, a `Pattern` object is created from the `pattern` string, using `Pattern.DOTALL` to allow the dot (`.`) to match line terminators.
# Step 4: A `Matcher` object is created using the `Pattern` and the `path`.
# Step 5: The method then calls `find()` on the `Matcher` to check if there's a match anywhere in the `path`.
# Step 6: The method returns the result of the `find()` call, which will be `true` if there's a match, and `false` otherwise.
# Step 7: Since the method has a boolean return value and performs pattern matching, it could benefit from `@param` and `@return` tags to explain the inputs and outputs.
# Step 8: For a brief summary, focus on the method's primary purpose of matching a path against a pattern.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public static boolean isSupertype(String name, String supertype) {
        String[] names = name.split("\\.");
        String[] superTypeNames = supertype.split("\\.");
        
        // Skip first two elements (com.sun.jmx)
        names = Arrays.copyOfRange(names, 2, names.length);
        superTypeNames = Arrays.copyOfRange(superTypeNames, 2, superTypeNames.length);

        if (names.length > superTypeNames.length) {
            return false;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {

                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isSupertype' and takes two parameters: a String 'name' and a String 'supertype'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so it returns true or false depending on whether one type is a supertype of another.
# Step 3: The function splits both names and superTypes by dots (.).
# Step 4: It skips the first two elements (presumably 'com.sun.jmx').
# Step 5: If the length of 'name' is greater than 'supertype', it returns false.
# Step 6: It compares elements one by one to check if 'name' is a supertype of 'supertype'.
# Step 7: The function checks if one type is a supertype of another by comparing elements after skipping the first two.
# Step 8: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 9: The final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.

### Example 5:
 Input:
 public boolean validateInput(String input, Set<Integer> validInputs) {
        return validInputs.contains(Integer.parseInt(input));
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'validateInput' and takes two parameters: a String 'input' and a Set of Integers 'validInputs'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true or false depending on some condition.
# Step 3: The function attempts to parse the input string as an integer.
# Step 4: It checks if the parsed integer is contained within the 'validInputs' set.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to validate if the input string, when parsed as an integer, is among the valid inputs.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:
Check if the input string is a valid integer.

### Example 6:
 Input:
public static String padString(String s, char paddingChar, int length) {
    if (s == null) return null;

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
    while (sb.length() < length) {
        sb.append(paddingChar);
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'padString' and takes three parameters: a String 's', a char 'paddingChar', and an int 'length'.
# Step 2: The return type is String, so the function returns a modified string.
# Step 3: The function checks if the input string 's' is null. If it is, the function returns null.
# Step 4: If the input string 's' is not null, the function creates a StringBuilder object initialized with 's'.
# Step 5: The function appends the 'paddingChar' to the StringBuilder object until its length reaches the specified 'length'.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to pad the input string with a specified character until it reaches the desired length.
# Step 7: Since it has parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus

 Input:
private static void removeAll(Collection<?> collection) {
    final Iterator<?> iterator = collection.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        iterator.remove();
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'removeAll' and takes one parameter: a Collection 'collection'.
# Step 2: It does not have a return type, implying it performs an action within the method.
# Step 3: The method iterates over the collection and removes each element using an Iterator.
# Step 4: The purpose of this function is to empty a collection by removing all its elements.
# Step 5: The final summary should accurately reflect the action performed by the method.

Output:
Removes all elements from a collection.
2876	Converts a ModelNode to an enum value.

        final Name nodeName = name.isEmpty() ? new CompositeName("") : name;
        return root.accept(new ListVisitor(nodeName));
    }

 Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'list' and takes one parameter: 'name'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'List<NameClassPair>', so the function returns a list of name-class pairs.
# Step 3: It checks if the input 'name' is empty and creates an empty 'CompositeName' if true; otherwise, it uses the provided 'name'.
# Step 4: It calls the 'accept' method on the 'root' object with a 'ListVisitor' and the 'nodeName' as arguments.
# Step 5: The 'ListVisitor' is likely a custom visitor class that accumulates 'NameClassPair' objects for the directory listing.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to list the contents of a directory given a name.
# Step 7: Since it may throw an exception and has a return value, '@param', '@return', and '@throws' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @param, @return, and @throws.

    try {
        return new CryptProvider().initialize() != null;
    } catch (GeneralSecurityException | IOException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'supportsCryptProvider' and takes no input parameters.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true or false.
# Step 3: It attempts to initialize a CryptProvider and checks if the initialization was successful.
# Step 4: If the initialization is successful, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
# Step 5: The function checks for CryptProvider support and handles any exceptions that might occur during initialization.
# Step 6: Since the function returns a boolean value, it should include '@return' tags to inform users about the output.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief sentence, plus the @return tag.

### Example 4:
 Input:
 ```java
 public boolean isAbsolutePath(String path) {
     return path != null && (path.startsWith("/") || path.startsWith("\\"));
 }
 ```
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isAbsolutePath' and takes one parameter: a String 'path'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean.
# Step 3: It checks whether the input path is null.
# Step 4: If not null, it checks if the path starts with either '/' or '\'.
# Step 5: The function returns true if the path is an absolute path, otherwise false.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to determine if a given string is an absolute file path.
# Step 7: Since the function takes an input parameter and returns a boolean, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a concise sentence, plus param and return tags.

Output:
Checks if a path is absolute.

    List<INDArray> result = new ArrayList<>();

    for (Writable element : arrayData) {
        INDArray indArray = Nd4j.create(element.toDouble());
        result.add(indArray);
    }

    return result;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'preprocessArray' and takes one parameter: an array of Writable objects.
# Step 2: It returns a List of INDArray.
# Step 3: It iterates over each Writable element, converts it to double, and creates an INDArray from it.
# Step 4: These INDArrays are added to a result list.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to convert an array of Writable objects into an array of INDArray.
# Step 6: Since the function has a return value, '@return' tag is appropriate.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus the '@return' tag.

        return true;
    }
    int annotatedDocCount = 0;
    for (DocumentMetadata metadata : this.metadataList) {

            }
        }
    }
    return (annotatedDocCount == this.myDocsCountDocs);
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isAnnotated' and takes no parameters.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true or false.
# Step 3: The function checks if all documents in a list are annotated based on certain conditions.
# Step 4: It counts annotated documents and compares it with the total count of documents.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to determine if all documents are annotated.
# Step 6: Since the function includes a return value, '@return' tag should be used to describe the output.
# Step 7: If the function is to be invoked frequently, additional comments or documentation explaining the conditions might be helpful.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus the @return tag.
Output:
Check if all documents are annotated.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public static boolean isWhitespace(String str) {
    if (str == null || str.length() == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        char c = str.charAt(i);
        if (!Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isWhitespace' and takes one parameter: a String 'str'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true if the string contains only whitespace characters, and false otherwise.
# Step 3: It loops through each character in the string.
# Step 4: For each character, it checks if it is a whitespace character using Character.isWhitespace method.
# Step 5: If it encounters a non-whitespace character, it returns false. If it finishes the loop without finding a non-whitespace character, it returns true.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to determine whether a given string consists entirely of whitespace characters.
# Step 7: Since it has a return value and check conditions, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @param and @return.
Output:
Check if a string is filled with whitespace.

### Example 5:
 Input:
public static long getDiskSpaceFreeBytes(Path path) {
    try {
        return Files.getFileStore(path).getUsableSpace();
    } catch (FileSystemException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Cannot determine disk space because " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'getDiskSpaceFreeBytes' and takes one parameter: a Path 'path'.
# Step 2: The return type is long, so the function returns the number of free bytes available on the disk space where the path is located.
# Step 3: It uses the Files.getFileStore method to get the file store associated with the given path.
# Step 4: It then calls the getUsableSpace method to get the number of usable space bytes on that file store.
# Step 5: If there is an error while retrieving the file store information, it throws a RuntimeException.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to determine the

### Example 5:
Input:
public static <E extends Comparable<E>> List<E> closest(List<E> list, E target) {
        if (list == null || list.size() == 0) return null;

        List<E> closest = new ArrayList<>();
        E closestValue = list.get(0);
        for (E element : list) {
            int diff = Math.abs(target.compareTo(element));
            if (diff == 0) {
                closestValue = element;
                break;
            } else if (diff < Math.abs(target.compareTo(closestValue))) {
                closestValue = element;
            }
        }

        closest.add(closestValue);
        return closest;
    }
Thought steps:
1. The function `closest` is defined as a method that takes a list of elements (`List<E>`) and a target element (`E`), where `E` extends `Comparable<E>`.
2. The method returns a list containing the closest element to the target from the input list.
3. The method first checks if the input list is null or empty, returning null if it is.
4. It initializes a variable `closestValue` with the first element of the list and iterates through the list to find the element that is closest to the target in terms of comparison.
5. The closest element is added to the `closest` list, which is then returned.

**Thought Footprint:** The method aims to find and return the element in the list that is closest to the target element based on its natural ordering.

**Final Output:** The method returns the closest element to a target in a list.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public static boolean contains(List<String> list, String value) {
        for (String item : list) {
            if (item.equals(value)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'contains' and takes two parameters: a List 'list' and a String 'value'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true or false.
# Step 3: It iterates through the list to check if the value exists.
# Step 4: If a match is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to check for the existence of a value in a list.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used for clarity.
# Step 7: Since it has a return value and may not handle exceptions, summarizes the function briefly using the input and output.

### Example 4:
Input:
public static List<Index> getColumnReferences() {
    List<Index> indexes = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, Table> entry : tables.entrySet()) {
        for (Map.Entry<String, Column> columnEntry : entry.getValue().getColumns().entrySet()) {
            if (columnEntry.getValue().hasIndexes()) {
                indexes.addAll(columnEntry.getValue().getIndexes());
            }
        }
    }
    return Collections.unmodifiableList(indexes);
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'getColumnReferences' and does not take any parameters.
# Step 2: It returns a List of Index objects.
# Step 3: It initializes an empty list to store index objects.
# Step 4: It iterates over a map of tables, then over the columns in each table.
# Step 5: If a column has indexes, it adds those indexes to the list.
# Step 6: Finally, it returns an unmodifiable view of the list of indexes.
# Step 7: The purpose is to collect all indexes from all columns of all tables.
# Step 8: The function uses generic types and collections, so '@return' and '@param' tags would be useful.
# Step 9: For brevity, a one-sentence summary suffices.
Output:
Collects all indexes from table columns.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public Conversion failFastOnEmpty()
 {
        return new Conversion()
        {
            @Override
            public Number getNumber(String key) { 
                if (obj.get(key) == null) {
                    fail("Market not found");
                }
                return getFloat(key);
            }
        };
} Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'failFastOnEmpty' and it takes no parameters.
# Step 2: It returns an anonymous object of type 'Conversion'.
# Step 3: The anonymous object overrides the 'getNumber' method of the 'Conversion' interface.
# Step 4: In the 'getNumber' method, it checks if the value for the given key is null in an internal object 'obj'.
# Step 5: If the value is null, it calls a 'fail' method with the argument "Market not found".
# Step 6: If the value is not null, it returns a float value for the key using the 'getFloat' method.
# Step 7: The function's purpose is to create a conversion object that will fail fast if it encounters an empty value.
# Step 8: Since it returns an object and may fail, '@return' and '@throws' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 9: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @return and @throws.
