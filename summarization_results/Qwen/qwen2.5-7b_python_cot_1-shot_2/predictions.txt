### Explanation:
This method registers a managed object with a KMIP appliance. It takes a `managed_object` as an argument, which must be an instance of `ManagedObject`. The method constructs object attributes based on the properties of the managed object, such as cryptographic usage masks, operation policy names, and names, and then registers the object with the appliance using the `proxy.register` method. If the registration is successful, it returns the unique identifier (`uid`) of the newly registered object. If the operation fails, it raises a `KmipOperationFailure` exception with the details of the failure.

### Key Points:

- Constructs object attributes based on the properties of the managed object.
- Registers the managed object with the KMIP appliance.
- Returns the `uid` of the newly registered object if successful.

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `calculate_item_depth` is defined as a method within a class.
   - It takes three parameters: `tree_alias`, `item_id`, and `depth` with a default value of `0`.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `tree_alias` (type: `str` or `unicode`): The alias of the tree.
   - `item_id` (type: `int`): The unique identifier of the item within the tree.
   - `depth` (type: `int`, default: `0`): The initial depth (usually 0 for the root).

3. **Docstring**:
   - The docstring explains that the function calculates the depth of an item in the tree structure.
   - It specifies the return type as `int`.

4. **Function Body**:
   - The function retrieves the item from the tree using `self.get_item_by_id(tree_alias, item_id)`.
   - If the item has an attribute `depth`, it updates the depth by adding the current depth value.
   - If the item does not have a `depth` attribute but has a parent, it recursively calls `calculate_item_depth` with the parent's ID and increments the depth by 1.
   - Finally, the function returns the calculated depth.

5. **Summary**:
   - The function calculates the depth of an item in a tree structure by recursively traversing its parent nodes and summing the depths.

### Explanation:
- **Function Name**: `_search_names`
- **Purpose**: To search for contacts in the contacts list where the contact's name matches a specified query.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: The string to search for in contact names.
  - Type: `str`
- **Yields**: A generator of `carddav_object.CarddavObject` that match the query.
- **Returns**:
  - Type: `generator(carddav_object.CarddavObject)`

### Steps:
1. **Compile Regex**: A regular expression is compiled with `re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL` flags to allow case-insensitive and dot-all matching.
2. **Iterate Through Contacts**: The function iterates through each contact stored in `self.contacts.values()`.
3. **Search in Contact Name**: For each contact, the function checks if the query matches the contact's full name using `regexp.search(contact.get_full_name())`.
4. **Yield Matching Contacts**: If a match is found, the contact is yielded as part of the generator.

# Step 1: The function is named 'close' and is defined as a method of a class (it takes 'self' as its first parameter).
# Step 2: It does not accept any parameters.
# Step 3: The docstring explains the purpose of the function.
# Step 4: The body of the function calls 'self.daf.file.close()' to close the file associated with the object.
# Step 5: It then iterates over each segment in 'self.segments'.
# Step 6: For each segment, it checks if the attribute '_data' exists using 'hasattr'.
# Step 7: If '_data' exists, it deletes the attribute using 'del segment._data'.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence.

### Explanation:
Step 1: The function `_read_quoted` is defined with one parameter `ctx` of type `ReaderContext`.
Step 2: It reads a quoted form from the input stream using the `ReaderContext`.
Step 3: The quoted form is expected to start with a single quote (`'`).
Step 4: After reading the starting quote, it reads the next form by calling `_read_next_consuming_comment(ctx)`.
Step 5: The function returns a list containing a symbol `_QUOTE` and the next form as elements.

9675	Add Pyblish to the Maya file menu using a hacky approach due to a lack of understanding of `evalDeferred` or `executeDeferred`.

```python
if hasattr(cmds, 'about') and not cmds.about(batch=True):
    # Force Maya to build its menus dynamically
    mel.eval("evalDeferred buildFileMenu")

    # Serialise the function into a string and add it to the menu
    script = inspect.getsource(_add_to_filemenu) + "\n_add_to_filemenu()"
    if cmds.getArgc() > 1 or cmds.about(batch=True):
        cmds.evalDeferred(script)
```

This function is used to add a Pyblish entry to the Maya file menu. It first checks if the Maya command module (`cmds`) has an `about` function and if it's not in batch mode. If these conditions are met, it forces Maya to build its menus dynamically using `mel.eval("evalDeferred buildFileMenu")`. Then, it serializes the `_add_to_filemenu` function into a string and appends a call to `_add_to_filemenu` at the end. Finally, if the number of command line arguments is greater than 1 or Maya is in batch mode, it evaluates the script deferred using `cmds.evalDeferred(script)`.

Note: The use of `evalDeferred` and a serialised function is considered hacky due to a lack of understanding of `evalDeferred` or `executeDeferred`. If a better solution is found, the function should be updated accordingly.

### Detailed breakdown of the steps for this method:
1. **Method Definition**: The function `chmod` is defined to change the permissions of a file or directory.
2. **Parameters**:
   - `path`: The file or directory path.
   - `mode`: The new permissions mode to be set.
   - `recursive`: A boolean indicating whether to apply permissions recursively (default is `True`).
3. **Conditional Command Construction**:
   - If `recursive` is `True`, the command is constructed as `chmod -R %s %s`, where `%s` will be replaced by `mode` and `path`.
   - If `recursive` is `False`, the command is constructed as `chmod %s %s`.
4. **Executing the Command**: The constructed command is passed to the `sh` function to execute it.
5. **Return Value**: The result of the command execution is returned.

This method effectively changes the permissions of a file or directory, either recursively or non-recursively, using the `chmod` system command and executing it through the `sh` function.

14872	Clean up on process shutdown. Stop the process if started and save data if auto_data is set.
14873	Excludes source lines from execution consideration based on a regular expression.
14874	Return a compiled regex for the given exclusion list.
14875	Saves the collected coverage data to a file with a unique suffix based on hostname, test name, process ID, and a random number.
14876	Combine multiple similarly-named coverage data files into the current measurements.

14878	Calls `analysis2` and returns the first, second, morpheme, and morph tag without excluded line numbers.
14879	Analyze a module to determine its coverage statistics, returning a tuple with filename, executable lines, excluded lines, missing lines, and formatted missing lines.
14880	Analyze a single morf or code unit. Returns an `Analysis` object.
14881	Generate a summary report for the given modules in `morfs` and write it to the specified `file`. The report includes counts of statements, executed statements, missing statements, and lines missed. The `include` and `omit` parameters allow filtering modules based on filename patterns, while `ignore_errors` and `show_missing` control the behavior of the report.
