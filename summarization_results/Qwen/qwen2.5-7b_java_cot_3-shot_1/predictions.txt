Thought steps:
# Step 1: The method is named 'getAvailablePorts' and takes two parameters: 'startPort' and 'endPort'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'List<Integer>', so it returns a list of available ports.
# Step 3: It iterates through a range of ports and tries to bind a ServerSocket to each one.
# Step 4: If successful, the port number is added to the list. If an exception is thrown, the port is not available.
# Step 5: The method's purpose is to find and return a list of available ports within a specified range.
# Step 6: Since it has a return value, '@return' tag is appropriate

### Example 4:
Input:
public String getMessage(String key, Locale locale) {
    return ResourceBundle.getBundle("messages", locale).getString(key);
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'getMessage' and takes two parameters: 'key' and 'locale'.
# Step 2: The return type is String, so the function returns a localized message.
# Step 3: It uses `ResourceBundle.getBundle` to load a bundle named "messages" specific to the given 'locale'.
# Step 4: It retrieves the message string for the given 'key' from the loaded bundle.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to retrieve a localized message based on a key and locale.
# Step 6: Since it has parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @param and @return.
Output:
Retrieves a localized message.

### Example 5:
 The following is a code snippet from a method that calculates the total commission for a given list of sales transactions.
```java
public static double calculateTotalCommission(double[] sales, double commissionRate) {
    double totalCommission = 0.0;
    for (double sale : sales) {
        totalCommission += sale * commissionRate;
    }
    return totalCommission;
}
```
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'calculateTotalCommission' and takes two parameters: a double array 'sales' and a double 'commissionRate'.
# Step 2: It has a return type 'double', meaning it returns a total commission amount.
# Step 3: It initializes a double variable 'totalCommission' to 0.0.
# Step 4: It iterates over each sale in the 'sales' array and adds the commission calculated by multiplying the sale amount by the commission rate to 'totalCommission'.
# Step 5: After iterating over all sales, it returns the 'totalCommission'.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to calculate the total commission for a list of sales transactions.

        if (str.charAt(i) == c) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'contains' and takes two parameters: a String 'str' and a char 'c'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true or false.
# Step 3: It iterates through the characters in the string to find the specified character.
# Step 4: The function's purpose is to check if a string contains a specific character.
# Step 5: Since it has a return value, '@return' tag is appropriate for the summary.
# Step 6: Given the simplicity of the function, a brief and concise summary is sufficient.
Output:

                .orElse(null);
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'highestValue' and takes one parameter: 'numberList'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'Integer', so the function returns the highest value in the list or null if the list is empty.
# Step 3: It uses Java Stream API to find the maximum value in the list.
# Step 4: If the list is empty, it returns null using 'orElse' method.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to find the maximum value in a list of integers.
# Step 6: Since it takes a parameter and returns a value, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @param and @return.
Output:
Returns the highest value from the provided list.

### Created Question:
### Example 4:
Input:
public static String formatTime(long time, String pattern) {
        DateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, Locale.US);
        return formatter.format(new Date(time));
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'formatTime' and takes two parameters: a long 'time' and a String 'pattern'.
# Step 2: The return type is a String, so the function returns the formatted time string.
# Step 3: It creates a DateFormat instance with the given pattern and Locale.US.
# Step 4: It creates a Date object from the time parameter.
# Step 5: It formats the Date object according to the pattern and returns the formatted string.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to convert a time in milliseconds to a formatted time string.
# Step 7: Since it takes parameters and returns a value, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:
Function to format time with a specified pattern.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public void process(List<String> lines) {
        String result = lines.stream()
                .map(this::transform)
                .filter(s -> s != null && !s.isEmpty())
                .collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));

        System.out.println(result);
    }

    private String transform(String line) {
        return line.toUpperCase();
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'process' and takes one parameter: a List of Strings 'lines'.
# Step 2: It processes each line by applying the 'transform' method.
# Step 3: It filters out null and empty strings before joining the remaining lines with a newline character.
# Step 4: The function outputs the processed and formatted result.
# Step 5: The 'transform' method converts a string to uppercase.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to transform and print a list of strings.
# Step 7: Since it has a return type of void and prints to the console, no return or throwing exception tags are necessary.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public static void forEach(List<?> list, Consumer<? super Object> action) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(list);
        Objects.requireNonNull(action);

        for (Object e : list) {
            action.accept(e);
        }
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'forEach' and takes one parameter: a List of any type and a Consumer.
# Step 2: The function does not return anything, so the return type is void.
# Step 3: It checks if the list and action are not null to prevent NullPointerException.
# Step 4: It iterates over each element in the list and applies the action to it.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to apply an action to each element of a list.
# Step 6: Since it has no return value but does perform an action, a single sentence summary is appropriate.
# Step 7: Output should be a brief and concise sentence.

### Example 4:
Input:
public static boolean isNumeric(String str) {
    if (str == null) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        char c = str.charAt(i);
        if (!Character.isDigit(c)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isNumeric' and takes one parameter: a String 'str'.
# Step 2: It returns a boolean.
# Step 3: The function checks if the input string is null.
# Step 4: If it is null, the function returns false.
# Step 5: The function then checks each character in the string to see if it is a digit.
# Step 6: If all characters are digits, the function returns true. If any character is not a digit, it returns false.
# Step 7: The function's purpose is to determine if a string represents a numeric value.
# Step 8: Although the function includes a parameter and a return value, the given summary does not seem to include these. The final summary will focus on

### Thought Steps:
- Method `setObjectProperty` takes three parameters: an `Object`, a `String` representing a property name, a `String` representing the property value, and a `boolean` indicating whether to ignore non-existing properties.
- The method attempts to find and invoke a method named `set` followed by the property name on the target object.
- If the method is not found and `ignoreNonExisting` is `false`, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- If the method is not found and `ignoreNonExisting` is `true`, a warning is logged.
- The method uses reflection to dynamically invoke the setter method and handles exceptions gracefully by logging or throwing an exception based on the `ignoreNonExisting` flag.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public boolean isValidEmail(String email) {
    String emailRegex = "^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+$";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(email);

    return matcher.find();
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isValidEmail' and takes one parameter: 'email'.
# Step 2: It returns a boolean, so the function returns true or false depending on whether the email is valid.
# Step 3: It uses a regular expression to define the pattern for a valid email.
# Step 4: It checks if the input string matches the email pattern.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to validate an email address using a regular expression.
# Step 6: Since it has a return value, '@return' tag is appropriate for the summary.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus the @return tag.
Output:

Input:
public final String padNumber(int value, int width) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < width - String.valueOf(value).length(); i++) {
        sb.append('0');
    }
    sb.append(value);
    return sb.toString();
}

Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'padNumber' and takes two parameters: an 'int' value and an 'int' width.
# Step 2: It has a return type 'String', which means it returns a string.
# Step 3: The function constructs a string representation of 'value' and pads it with leading zeros until its length is equal to 'width'.
# Step 4: The function's purpose is to pad a number with leading zeros to match a desired width.
# Step 5: Since it returns a string and has no exceptions, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 6: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @param and @return.
Output:
