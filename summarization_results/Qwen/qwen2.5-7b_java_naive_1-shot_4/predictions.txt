6624	Allocate a new buffer when the current buffer is full.
6625	Write a block of bytes to the output stream.
6626	Write a single byte to the internal buffer.

In this implementation, `write(int b)` is overridden because the superclass mandates it. When you provide an integer `b` as an argument, it moves the byte version of that integer, which is `b & 0xFF` (or equivalently, `(byte) b`), to the current buffer. The position is tracked by `inBufferPos`. If the current buffer is full, a new one is allocated by calling `needNewBuffer(count + 1)`, and the position is reset to `0`. The position is incremented by `1` to reflect this addition.

Here is how to produce the summary:

1. Identify the method's purpose: The method is a `write` method, which means it is used to write data, in this case, single bytes.
2. Describe what data is being written: The method writes a single `int` value, which is treated as a byte.
3. Describe where the data is being written: The method writes data to an internal buffer.
4. Handle edge cases: If the buffer is full, the method allocates a new buffer and resets the position.

Combining the steps produces the following summary:
Write a single byte to the internal buffer.
6627	Reads data from the specified `InputStream` and stores it in the buffer, returning the total number of bytes read.

Write the contents of the buffers to the output stream.
