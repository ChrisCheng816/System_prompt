### Explanation:
### Step 1: The function is named 'activate_matplotlib' and it is defined to activate a given matplotlib backend.
### Step 2: It accepts one parameter: 'backend' (the backend to activate).
### Step 3: The function first imports the matplotlib module.
### Step 4: It checks if the backend starts with 'module://'. If so, it directly sets the backend using `matplotlib.rcParams['backend']`, addressing a bug related to backend name case sensitivity.
### Step 5: If the backend does not start with 'module://', it uses `matplotlib.use()` to activate the backend.
### Step 6: It sets matplotlib to interactive mode with `matplotlib.interactive(True)`.
### Step 7: The function then imports matplotlib's pylab module.
### Step 8: It attempts to comment out the lines related to switching backend interactively for further discussions.
### Step 9: It modifies `pylab.show._needmain` to `False` to disable main loop execution.
### Step 10: The function wraps `pylab.draw_if_interactive` with a decorator to track whether `show()` has been called.
### Summary: The method activates the specified matplotlib backend and sets interactive mode to True, ensuring that the plotting environment is properly configured.
