Performs the backward update step for a Kalman smoother. Given the filtered and predicted parameters at time step t and t+1, along with the next posterior parameters at time step t+1 and the transition matrix A(t+1), computes the 1-step backward smoothed distribution parameters.

The updates are derived using the backward Kalman gain matrix J:
- `posterior_mean = filtered_mean + J * (next_posterior_mean - predicted_mean)`
- `posterior_cov = filtered_cov + J * (next_posterior_cov - predicted_cov) * J'`

The algorithm initializes from mu(T | 1:T) and sigma(T | 1:T), calculated by the forward filter.

  - transition_matrix: `LinearOperator` with shape `[latent_size, latent_size]` and a batch shape broadcastable to `B`.

**Returns:**
  - posterior_mean: Tensor with shape `[latent_size, 1]` and batch shape `B`, representing mu(t | 1:T).

5949	When provided with keyword arguments of the form `col=pattern`, this method will limit the entities returned to those that include the provided pattern. Note that 'like' queries require that the `prefix=True` option must have been provided as part of the column definition. Patterns allow for 4 wildcard characters, whose semantics are as follows:  * `*?*` - will match 0 or 1 of any character  * `*\**` - will match 0 or more of any character  * `*+*` - will match 1 or more of any character  * `*!*` - will match exactly 1 of any character As an example, imagine that you have enabled the required prefix matching on your `User.email` column. And lets say that you want to find everyone with an email address that contains the name 'frank' before the `@` sign. You can use either of the following patterns to discover those users:  * `*frank*@*`  * `*frank*@*` .. note:: Like queries implicitly start at the beginning of strings checked, so if you want to match a pattern that doesn't start at the beginning of a string, you should prefix it with one of the wildcard characters (like `*` as we did with the 'frank' pattern).
5950	This function executes a query and returns a key where the results will be stored for pagination, further operations, etc. It sets an expiration time on the key for eventual deletion unless the PERSIST command is used. The function checks for filter or order criteria and raises a QueryError if they are missing. It also checks if the timeout is a positive integer and raises a QueryError if not. Finally, it calls the search function with the model, filters, order by, and timeout as arguments.
5951	Return only the first result from the query, if any.
5952	Delete entities that match the query, chunk-by-chunk to avoid memory overflow.
5953	This code handles the deletion of an entity (`ent`) and manages the cascading effects on related entities based on specified actions ('no action', 'restrict', 'set null', 'set default', or 'cascade').

5960	This function refreshes indices for all entities in a provided model by fetching them in blocks and committing index-only updates.
5961	```markdown
**Summary:**

This utility function cleans up old index data from a Redis model that was accidentally left during item deletion in ROM versions <= 0.27.0. It ensures all index data is up-to-date by re-checking and removing redundant entries, yielding progress through the process. The function supports different strategies based on Redis version and supports optional parameters for block size and forcing the use of HSCAN for index cleaning.

**Key Features:**
- Cleans old index data.
- Supports different Redis versions.
- Yields progress during the cleaning process.
- Handles unique indexes.

If there is data in `store_dict` that is not known how to store, it picks default storage flags. If `overwrite` is set, it deletes the existing data and stores the new data. It then stores the annotations and updates the meta information and summary tables if a new group or parameter was created.

    equivalent. Mutagen tries to use mmap to resize the file, but
    falls back to a significantly slower method if mmap fails.
    """
    locked = False
    assert 0 < size
    assert 0 <= offset
    fobj.seek(0, 2)
    filesize = fobj.tell()
    movesize = filesize - offset - size
    assert 0 <= movesize
    try:
        if movesize > 0:

                try:
                    file_map.move(offset, offset + size, movesize)
                finally:
                    file_map.close()
            except (ValueError, EnvironmentError, ImportError):

                    fobj.write(buf)
                    offset += len(buf)

        fobj.flush()
    finally:
        if locked:
            unlock(fobj)
```

Output:
After running this function, `size` bytes starting at `offset` in the file object `fobj` will be deleted. If `mmap` is available, it uses `mmap.move` to efficiently delete the bytes. If `mmap` fails, it falls back to a slower method using file operations.

It also handles exceptions for `EOF` and `TIMEOUT` by returning the index of the corresponding special value in the pattern list. After a match, it sets instance attributes `before`, `after`, and `match` with relevant data, and it can be configured with a timeout and search window size.
13718	This method implements a loop for searching a pattern in a buffer. It repeatedly reads data from the buffer and searches for the pattern using a provided searcher object.
