### Explanation:
1. The code defines a method named `get_authorization_code_from_uri` which is used to extract an authorization code from a given URI.
2. The URI's query string parameters are parsed and validated to ensure the presence of essential parameters like `response_type`, `client_id`, and `redirect_uri`.
3. If these parameters are missing, appropriate exceptions are raised and handled.
4. Depending on the validity of the URI, the method either returns the authorization code or handles exceptions by redirecting to a specific error response.

---

The provided code snippet defines a function named `populate_state_register`. This function takes two parameters: `all_seq`, which is a list of sequences, and `sr`, which is an instance of `state.StateRegister`. The function creates a default state `s0` for the `StateRegister` and connects it using `Edge`. It then iterates over each sequence in `all_seq`, merging them into one tree automata, and returns the final `Edge`.

In summary, the function populates the state register with states derived from sequences and connects them.
