4002	Create a certificate request with specified key, digest, and subject details返回
4003	Generate a certificate from a request.

Here's how to systematically approach it:

1. Understand the method `createCertificate`:
   - Identifies that `req` should be a certificate request.
   - `issuerCertKey`, `serial`, `validityPeriod`, and `digest` are parameters with specific roles.
   
2. Parse the document string:
   - The docstring explains the task: generating a certificate based on a request, issuer's certificate and key, serial number, and validity period.
   - Default for `digest` is "sha256".
   
3. Identify the key actions:
   - Extract details from `issuerCertKey` and `validityPeriod`.
   - Initialize an X509 object and set its serial number, validity period, issuer, and subject.
   - Add the public key from the request.
   - Sign the certificate using the issuer's private key and specified digest method.
   - Return the signed certificate.

These steps provide a clear outline to ensure clarity and conciseness.

By following these thoughts, the function generates a certificate from a request, setting various attributes and signing it with the issuer's key.

Explanation:
- The function `find_config` looks for a `Config` object among the given `children`.
- It first checks if there's a `config` keyword argument, converting it to a `Config` object if necessary.
- If not found, it searches the other children for a `Config` object.
- If no `Config` is found, it looks in any `Directory` children for a `config` key or a `Config` object.
- It returns the first `Config` object it finds, either from the keyword argument or from the children.

# Step 2: It accepts one parameter: 'path' (required), which specifies a relative path.
# Step 3: The docstring explains that the function returns a 'ConfigNode' object representing a child node with the specified relative path.
# Step 4: If 'self._path' exists, it appends 'path' to form a full path.
# Step 5: The function returns a new 'ConfigNode' object with the current root and the updated path.
# Step 6: The final summary will be a concise and abstract sentence explaining the purpose of the function.

### explanation
The function `display_html` is defined to take multiple objects and possibly keyword arguments. It determines whether the objects are raw HTML data or Python objects. If raw data is provided, it iterates through each object and calls `publish_html` to display them. If it's Python objects, it calls `display` with specific content types to render them as HTML.
14887	Display SVG representation of objects.
14888	Display PNGs from objects or raw data.
14889	Display JPEG representation of objects.
14890	Display LaTeX representation of objects using 'display' or 'publish_latex' depending on whether the data is raw or not.
14891	Display JSON for given objects.
14892	Display Python objects as JavaScript.
14893	Reload the data from file or URL.
14894	Find the full path to a command using which.
14895	Execute a shell command and return the exit status.
14896	Forward read events from a file descriptor over a socket using ZeroMQ.
14897	Grade response.

Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function 'run' is defined as a method of a class and performs specific operations.
# Step 2: It reads lines from 'self.fd' and sends them over 'self.sock'.
# Step 3: The function handles Unicode lines specifically.
# Step 4: It continues processing until the end of the file (EOF).
# Step 5: After processing completes, it closes 'self.fd' and 'self.sock'.
# Step 6: The final summary should capture the primary action and outcome of the function.

Read and send lines from file over socket.
