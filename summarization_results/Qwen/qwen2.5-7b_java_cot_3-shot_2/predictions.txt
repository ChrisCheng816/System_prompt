### Example 4:
 Input:
 public static void waitForExit(Process process) throws InterruptedException {
     int exitCode = -1;
     try {
         exitCode = process.waitFor();
     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
         Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
         throw e;
     }
     System.out.println("Exited with code " + exitCode);
 }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'waitForExit' and takes one parameter: a Process 'process'.
# Step 2: The return type is void, meaning the function does not return anything.
# Step 3: It waits for the specified process to finish execution.
# Step 4: It catches an InterruptedException if the thread is interrupted while waiting and rethrows it after interrupting the current thread.
# Step 5: After the process exits, it prints the exit code.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to block until the given process terminates and print its exit code.
# Step 7: Since it may throw an exception, '@throws' tag is appropriate for the summary.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus the @throws tag.

 Input:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<String> lines = readLines("example.txt");
    for (String line : lines) {
        if (line.contains("error")) {
            System.out.println("Error detected: " + line);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Processed line: " + line);
        }
    }
}
```
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The method `main` is the entry point of the Java application.
# Step 2: It reads lines from a file named "example.txt" using a helper method `readLines`.
# Step 3: It iterates over each line and checks if the line contains the word "error".
# Step 4: If "error" is found, it prints it with a specific message; otherwise, it prints a generic message.
# Step 5: The method demonstrates basic file handling and string operations in Java.
# Step 6: Since it involves input/output operations and looping, it should mention that it handles a file and processes its lines.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus a tag indicating the IOException that can be thrown.

Output:

### Example 6:
Input:
public int[] getArray() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Empty list");
    }
    int[] array = new int[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        array[i] = values.get(i);
    }
    return array;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'getArray' and takes no input parameters.
# Step 2: It returns an array of integers.
# Step 3: It checks if the list is empty.
# Step 4: If the list is empty, it throws a RuntimeException with the message "Empty list".
# Step 5: Otherwise, it creates an array of integers with the same size as the list.
# Step 6: It iterates over the list and assigns each value to the corresponding position in the array.
# Step 7: Finally, it returns the array.
# Step 8: The function converts the list of integers to an array.
# Step 9: Since it returns a value and may throw an exception, '@return' and '@throws' tags are appropriate for the summary.
Output:
Returns an array containing the elements of the list.

Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'addAndMonitor' and takes two parameters: a Map 'operMap' and an Iterator 'iter'.
# Step 2: The function does not have a return value (void).
# Step 3: It first checks if 'operMap' is null and throws a NullPointerException if it is.
# Step 4: It processes 'iter' by checking if each object is an instance of 'FileOperation' and calling 'read' or 'write' method accordingly.
# Step 5: It iterates over the values of 'operMap' and does the same processing as above.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to process a map of FileOperation instances, invoking 'read' or 'write' based on the operation type.
# Step 7: Since the function does not return a value but can throw exceptions, no '@return' tag is needed. The '@throws' tag should be used to indicate possible exceptions.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus the '@throws' tag.

Thought steps:
# Step 1: The method is named 'unbind' and takes a single parameter: 'name'.
# Step 2: The parameter 'name' should be a non-null and non-empty string representing the JNDI name.
# Step 3: The method is part of an interface that handles unbinding processes.
# Step 4: Before unbinding, it checks if the 'name' is valid, and if not, throws an appropriate message.
# Step 5: The method retrieves the BindInfo using 'ContextNames.bindInfoFor(name)'.
# Step 6: It fetches the binding service using 'container.getService(bindInfo.getBinderServiceName())'.
# Step 7: If the binding service does not exist, a debug log is output, and the method returns without performing any action.
# Step 8: The binding service is updated to removal mode.
# Step 9: A 'StabilityMonitor' is created and added to the binding service to monitor stability changes during the unbind process.
# Step 10: The 'awaitStability' method is called to wait until the service becomes stable, and logs a successful unbind message.
# Step 11: If an 'InterruptedException' occurs, an error message is logged indicating that the unbind operation was interrupted.
# Step 12: Finally, the StabilityMonitor's controller is removed.

### Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'moveFlattededEqualitiesLeft' and takes one parameter: a List of OAndBlock 'flattenedWhereClause'.
# Step 2: It checks if 'flattenedWhereClause' is null and returns null if true.
# Step 3: It initializes an empty list 'result' to store the modified OAndBlock objects.
# Step 4: It iterates through each OAndBlock in 'flattenedWhereClause'.
# Step 5: For each OAndBlock, it separates the Boolean expressions into equality and non-equality expressions.
# Step 6: It creates a new OAndBlock 'newAnd' and adds all equality expressions followed by non-equality expressions to it.
# Step 7: It adds the new OAndBlock to the 'result' list.
# Step 8: Finally, it returns the 'result' list containing modified OAndBlock objects.
# Step 9: The function's purpose is to reorganize Boolean expressions within each OAndBlock by moving all equality expressions to the left of non-equality expressions.
# Step 10: Since it processes a list of OAndBlock objects and returns a modified list, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 11: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus tags @param and @return.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public int[] findMissingNumbers(int[] nums, int n) {
        int[] result = new int[n-1];

        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            result[i] = i + 2;
        }

        for (int num : nums) {
            result[num - 2] = 0;
        }

                return new int[]{result[i], i + 2};
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'findMissingNumbers' and takes two parameters: an integer array 'nums' and an integer 'n'.
# Step 2: The return type is int[], so the function returns an array of integers.
# Step 3: It creates an array 'result' of length 'n-1'.
# Step 4: It initializes 'result' with numbers from 2 to n.
# Step 5: It iterates through the input 'nums' and sets the corresponding values in 'result' to 0.
# Step 6: It iterates through 'result' again and returns the first two non-zero values.
# Step 7: The function's purpose is to find the two missing numbers in a sequence from 1 to n.
# Step 8: Since it has a return value, the '@return' tag is appropriate for the summary.
# Step 9: The final summary will be a brief sentence, plus a tag @return.

        if (versionStrings.length < 2) {
            return oss;
        }
        String version = versionStrings[1];
        if (version.isEmpty()) {
            return oss;

            return oss;
        }
        return null;
    }

Thought Steps:
1. The function `getLatestVersion` takes a string `oss` which represents an OSS version.
2. Split the input string `oss` using delimiter "-v" to get the actual version number.
3. Check if the version string is valid. It should contain exactly three numeric segments separated by dots.
4. Parse each segment of the version number to integers (major, minor, patch).
5. Compare the parsed version with the current version (`CURRENT_MAJOR`, `CURRENT_MINOR`, `CURRENT_PATCH`).
6. If the parsed version is less than the current version, return `null` indicating the version is not the latest. Otherwise, return the original version.

### Output:
Return the latest version of the OSS, or `null` if the version is not the latest.

### Example 2:
Input:
public static String encodePublicKey(PublicKey key) {
    byte[] bytes = key.getEncoded();
    boolean hasHeader = bytes.length > 300;
    byte[] header = hasHeader ? new byte[]{3, 0, 1, 0, 1} : new byte[]{1, 0, 1};
    return toBase64(encodeKey(header, bytes));
}
Thought Steps:
# Step 1: The function `encodePublicKey` takes a single parameter `key` of type `PublicKey`.
# Step 2: The function extracts the encoded form of the key using `key.getEncoded()`.
# Step 3: It checks if the length of the encoded bytes is greater than 300 to determine if a header is needed.
# Step 4: Based on the requirement, it creates either a `header` array of length 5 or 2.
# Step 5: The function then calls `encodeKey` with the appropriate header and encoded bytes, and finally encodes the result to Base64.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to encode a public key for use in a secure format.
# Step 7: As it manipulates and encodes data, '@param' and '@return' tags should be included.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a concise sentence including the purpose and usage of the function.

### Example 4:
 Input:
public String getStatusMessage() {
        StringBuilder statusMessage = new StringBuilder();
        if (status.isRunning()) {
            statusMessage.append("Height: ").append(this.height);
        }

        evaluateWarnings();
        evaluateErrors();
        statusMessage.append(getColoredTime());
        return statusMessage.toString();
    }

Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'getStatusMessage' and takes no parameters.
# Step 2: The return type is a String containing a status message.
# Step 3: A StringBuilder is used to construct the status message.
# Step 4: If the status is running, it appends the height to the message.
# Step 5: It calls three helper methods: evaluateDebug, evaluateWarnings, and evaluateErrors to add relevant information to the message.
# Step 6: getColoredTime() is called to.append the time with a color code.
# Step 7: Finally, it returns the constructed status message.
# Step 8: Since the function returns a string, '@return' and '@throws' tags can be omitted for a brief summary.
# Step 9: The final summary will be a short sentence plus a return tag.

# Step 2: It has a return type of Group, meaning it returns the added group 'g'.
# Step 3: The function first checks if the 'immutable' flag is set to true, and throws an IllegalStateException if true.
# Step 4: If the 'parent' is null, it assigns the 'rootGroup' to 'parent'.
# Step 5: It then calls the 'addGroup' method on 'parent' with 'g' as the argument to add the group to the parent.
# Step 6: Finally, it returns the added group 'g'.
# Step 7: The function's purpose is to add a group to a parent group, with checks for immutability and handling null parent cases.
# Step 8: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.

### Notes for the above solution:
1. The function `getPixelValues` takes a `byte[]` parameter named `imageBytes`, representing the image data in TIFF format.
2. It uses a class `TiffReader` to read the TIFF image from the `imageBytes` and retrieves the file directory.
3. The `validateImageType` method is called to check if the image type is valid.
4. It then reads the rasters from the file directory.
5. A float array `pixels` is created to store the pixel values, with a size equal to the product of the width and height of the rasters.
6. The function iterates over each pixel in the rasters, retrieves the sample index, and assigns the pixel value to the corresponding index in the `pixels` array.
7. Finally, the function returns the `pixels` array containing the image pixel values.

### Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'process' and takes no input parameters.
# Step 2: It has a return type of 'void', meaning it does not return any value.
# Step 3: It throws 'IOException', indicating it may cause input/output errors during execution.
# Step 4: The body of the function retrieves the current configuration using 'Context.get().getConfig()'.
# Step 5: It then schedules cache and model updates using the 'scheduleWithPeriod' methods of 'cacheSchedulerHelper' and 'modelSchedulerHelper', respectively, with the update periods specified in the configuration.
# Step 6: Finally, it calls the 'serveProcessedBundle' method of 'resourceBundleProcessor' to serve the processed bundle.
# Step 7: The function appears to handle periodic updates and serving of processed resources.
# Step 8: Since it throws an exception and has no return value, '@throws' is appropriate for the summary.
# Step 9: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence, plus the @throws tag.
Output:
Handles periodic updates and serves processed resources.

### Example 2:
Input:
public boolean isValidHttpUrl(String url) {
    if (url == null) {
        return false;
    }

    String trimmedUrl = url.trim();
    if (trimmedUrl.isEmpty()) {
        return false;
    }

    try {
        new URI(trimmedUrl);
    } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
        return false;
    }

    if (!trimmedUrl.startsWith("http://") && !trimmedUrl.startsWith("https://")) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isValidHttpUrl' and takes one parameter: 'url'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'boolean', indicating it returns true or false.
# Step 3: It checks if the input 'url' is null and returns false if it is.
# Step 4: It trims any leading or trailing whitespace from the URL.
# Step 5: If the trimmed URL is empty, it returns false.
# Step 6: It attempts to create a new URI object from the trimmed URL. If this fails due to a URI syntax error, it catches the 'URISyntaxException' and returns false.
# Step 7: It checks if the protocol of the URL is either "http" or "https". If not

### Example 4:
 Input:
 public String execute(String jar, String main, String[] args) {
        try {
            return executeWithArgs(jar, main, args);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return ".error." + e.getMessage();
        }
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'execute' and takes three parameters: 'jar', 'main', and 'args'.
# Step 2: The return type is String, so the function returns a string result.
# Step 3: It calls another function 'executeWithArgs' with the provided parameters.
# Step 4: If 'executeWithArgs' throws an exception, the function catches it and returns a string starting with ".error." followed by the exception message.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to execute a jar file with a specified main class and arguments, handling exceptions.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:
Execute the the job jar and return the result as string.

### Example 5:
 Input:
 public ',', String[]) {
    if (buffer == null || buffer.length < length) {
        int newLen = Math.max(initialLength, length);
        synchronized (this) {
            buffer = new char[newLen];
        }
    }
    return this;
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'ensureCapacityInternal' and takes two parameters: a character (likely a placeholder for a larger set of characters), and an integer 'length'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'this', which is a typical pattern for chained method calls.
# Step 3: It checks if the current buffer is null or if it is shorter than the specified length.
# Step 4: If either condition is true, it calculates a new length as the maximum of the current initial length and the specified length.
# Step 5: It synchronizes on 'this' to ensure thread safety when creating a new buffer.
# Step 6: A new character array is created with the calculated length, and the buffer is updated to point to this new array.
# Step 7: The function's purpose is to ensure that the internal buffer has enough capacity

# Step 1: The function is named 'findEditor' and takes one parameter: a String 'typeName'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'PropertyEditor', so the function returns a PropertyEditor object.
# Step 3: The function first attempts to get the Class object for the primitive type corresponding to the given type name using 'Classes.getPrimitiveTypeForName'.
# Step 4: If it is a primitive type, it returns the PropertyEditor found for that type using 'PropertyEditorManager.findEditor'.
# Step 5: If it is not a primitive type, it retrieves the current thread's context ClassLoader.
# Step 6: It uses the ClassLoader to load the Class object corresponding to the given type name.
# Step 7: Finally, it uses 'PropertyEditorManager.findEditor' to find and return the PropertyEditor for the loaded Class object.
# Step 8: The function attempts to find a PropertyEditor for a given type name, handling both primitive and non-primitive types.
# Step 9: Since it has specific logic and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags are appropriate for the summary.
# Step 10: The final summary should capture the purpose and functionality of the method.
