It returns a map of the minimal set of nodes required to execute a sharded query. The method first attempts to use the local node if it covers any of the query clusters. If not, it iteratively selects the node that covers the most uncovered clusters until all clusters are covered or an exception is thrown if some clusters are not present on any node.
2920	Move equality expressions to the left side of an AND block.
2921	If not all order conditions are met, this method returns early. It then calculates additional order by projections and updates the query planning info accordingly.
2922	The method `extractSubQueries` processes sub-queries from a `QueryPlanningInfo` object. It uses a `SubQueryCollector` to extract and categorize sub-queries based on whether they refer to the parent record. The method then adds these sub-queries to either the record-level or global scope in the `QueryPlanningInfo` object, and finally resets the collector. The process is repeated for different parts of the query (perRecordLetClause, whereClause, projection, orderBy, groupBy).
2923	This method checks if a record belongs to any of the specified clusters. It takes a record ID, a set of cluster names to filter by, and a database instance as input. If the filter set is null, it throws an exception. Otherwise, it retrieves the cluster name associated with the record from the database and checks if this name is contained in the filter set, returning the result.
2924	Check if the class and order by fields match an index and modify the execution plan accordingly.
2925	The method checks for an acyclic graph hierarchy, determining if there's a diamond-shaped cycle among subclasses. It uses a set to track visited classes and a list as a queue for traversal. If a subclass is encountered that has already been visited, the method returns true, indicating a diamond cycle. If no cycles are found after traversing all subclasses, it returns false.
2926	Determines if the order direction in a query is consistent (all ASC or all DESC) or if it's mixed. Returns null if there is no order or inconsistent directions.
2927	This method checks if a given key condition requires multiple index lookups. It iterates through each sub-block in the key condition and returns true if any sub-block is not an instance of OBinaryCondition, indicating the need for multiple lookups.
2928	Find the best index for a given query block and class, considering cost, indexed fields, and filter conditions.
2929	Builds an index search descriptor for full-text searches, copying and modifying the original block to include contains text conditions for each indexed field, and returns the modified descriptor if successful. Returns null if no matching indexed fields found or if hash index does not support partial key match.
2930	Combines multiple `IndexSearchDescriptor` instances into a single list by aggregating common indices and conditions, applying OR logic to additional filters.
2931	Creates and returns an ODocumentFieldHandlingStrategy based on the provided strategy value. Registers the strategy in the ODocumentFieldHandlingStrategyRegistry if it's not already registered.
2932	Checks if a user has permission to execute an operation on a specific resource, and returns the allowed role; throws an exception if no permission.
2933	Checks if a rule is defined for a given resource, iterating through roles and returning true if any role has the rule, otherwise false. Logs a warning if a role is null.
2934	Method that constructs a compact string representation of the server status by iterating through server members, appending their names, statuses, and database configurations.
2935	Initialize system database, configure autoDeploy, remove new node, update configuration, and register database.
2936	loadLocalDatabases() gets a list of available databases, sorts them, and iterates through them. For each database, if it doesn't exist, it logs, initializes the storage, acquires a lock, logs the current node's role, registers the database, resumes it, adds the node to the server list, reassigns cluster ownership, saves the distributed LSN, and sets the database online.
2937	```
Handles membership event when a member is removed, updates last cluster change, gets node name, removes server, and logs errors.
```
2938	This method elects a new lock manager by trying to acquire a lock on a distributed object, then iterating through a list of registered servers to find an available one to take over the lock manager role. If a valid server is found, it updates the lock manager's configuration and logs the election process.
2939	This method assigns a lock manager from a cluster. It checks if there's only one active node and sets it as the lock manager. If not, it tries to get the lock manager from the configuration map. If the current node is the lock manager, it force-releases the lock and has a new election. It retries until it finds a valid lock manager.
2940	Decrease transaction level, then commit if level reaches zero.
2941	Abort a micro-transaction if it's inactive or unbalanced, decrement the level, and perform a rollback if the level reaches zero.
2942	This method updates the identity of a record after a transaction commit. If the old and new RIDs are the same, it returns immediately. It then identifies possibly affected index keys and updates the index entries accordingly. Finally, it updates the record operation to reflect the new RID.
2943	Deletes records from the database cache after a rollback.
2944	Deletes existing file at given path, logs warning, and creates necessary parent directories.
2945	Moves a file from source to target atomically, falls back to regular move if atomic move is not supported.
2946	The method `getDisjointPatterns` constructs a list of `Pattern` objects. It starts by creating a reverse map `reverseMap` that associates `PatternNode` with their corresponding alias. Then, it iterates through `reverseMap` to build separate `Pattern` objects. For each `Pattern`, it uses a set `toVisit` to traverse connected nodes and add them to the pattern. It removes visited nodes from `reverseMap` and adds their neighbors to `toVisit`. After building a pattern, it recalculates the number of edges. The process continues until all nodes are visited. Finally, it returns the list of disjoint patterns.

If the input object is not an instance of OIdentifiable, it returns null. The method then iterates through the field chain, following references to nested ODocument objects, until it reaches the last document. It retrieves the schema class and property for the last field and returns the associated collate object. If any step fails (e.g., if an expected document is null or the property is not found), it returns null.

It performs several checks to ensure the validity of the input parameters, including `sbbEntity`, `eventObject`, `aci`, and `address`. It also handles activity context management by ensuring that the activity is not in the process of ending before firing the event. The method uses a transaction manager to manage the transactional aspect of the operation, and it invokes the `fireEvent` method on the activity context to dispatch the event. If the event is a re-fire, it copies the reference handler from the existing event being delivered.

7036	Checks if a deployable unit should be accepted based on its URL and name. Determines acceptance by checking against a predefined list of acceptable file names and, if not present, by attempting to open the JAR file to find the deployable-unit.xml descriptor. If any exceptions occur during this process, the unit is rejected.
7037	The method `init` initializes a deployable unit by processing its URL and deployable unit name. It checks if the unit can be removed from a list (`toAccept`), creates a deployable component, and either updates an existing deployable unit or creates a new one if the unit is a JAR file. It handles deployment descriptors, iterates through JAR and service entries, and manages deployable units and subcomponents.
7038	The method `start` initializes a `DeployableUnitWrapper` and logs a trace message if logging is enabled. It then attempts to retrieve a deployable unit from a map using the file name.

Input:
Action createFactory有的玩家是单人游戏，有的玩家是多人游戏。如果是单人游戏，玩家可以自己创建一个工厂。如果是多人游戏，玩家需要邀请其他玩家来创建一个工厂。多线程环境下，应该使用线程安全的方法来实现这一点。如果需要对工厂进行一些操作，可以考虑使用工厂模式来实现。

Output:
CreateFactory method in single-player games allows players to create a factory themselves. In multiplayer games, players need to invite others to create a factory. In a multi-threaded environment, thread-safe methods should be used for implementation. If operations on the factory are required, the factory pattern can be considered for implementation.
7830	Find and eliminate empty arcs in a state machine until none remain, then dump the resulting NFA.
7831	This method checks if an arc in a state machine is empty and handles it accordingly. If the arc is a vacuous loop, it removes the arc and returns true. Otherwise, it determines whether to move or copy arcs from the source to the destination state based on the number of incoming and outgoing arcs. If the source state has more outgoing arcs or the same number but fewer incoming arcs, it works on the source state. If the destination state has more incoming arcs or the same number but fewer outgoing arcs, it works on the destination state. It then removes the original arc and performs the move or copy operation, freeing any states that no longer have any incoming or outgoing arcs. The method finally returns true.

10912	Creates a BufferedImage with error text, calculating the font size and position based on the input lines.
10913	### Summary:
Downloads an image from a given URL, handles timeouts and errors, and returns the image or an error image with details.
10914	Sends a GET request to a specified URL, reads the response, and returns it as a JSONResult. Handles exceptions by throwing a FireRESTException with the URL and original exception.
10915	Reverses the mapping of key-value pairs from the source map to the target map
10916	Computes the cartesian product of two sets, ensuring no duplicates, then returns the result as an immutable set.
10917	Starts the method only if not already running and unused, sets the thread as a daemon, and then calls the superclass start method.
10918	If the pool is not null, it attempts to return the object to the pool, logs any exceptions, and then sets the pool reference to null.
10919	Optional<EndedEvent> createEndedEvent(Identification source) { try { EndedEvent stopRequest = new EndedEvent(source); return Optional.of(stopRequest); } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { return Optional.empty(); } }
10920	Returns the current track info from the queue at the current position, returns null if position is out of bounds.
10921	Update a track in the playlist.
10922	Shuffles the playlist starting from the current position. If the position is valid, it shuffles only the remaining tracks. Otherwise, it shuffles the entire playlist.
10923	Verifies if a list of playback modes is supported by device capabilities. Returns false if any mode is not supported, true otherwise.
10924	This method exports data from a queue and playback modes into a HashMap. It iterates through the queue, adding each item's exported data with a unique key. It also adds the names of playback modes and additional metadata (name, position, and data) to the map before returning it.
10925	Converts special characters in a string to their corresponding XML entities.
10926	Verifies the challenge, generates a response, encodes it if not null, sends authentication to the server.
10927	Converts object to JSON and returns as a ByteArrayOutputStream.
10928	The `run` method continuously processes events from a blocking queue. It handles each event, generates output extensions, manages timeouts, and notifies when processing is complete.
10929	Handles an event by retrieving its topic and logging it. Determines the appropriate queue based on the event's TTL and saves the event in that queue. If the TTL cannot be satisfied, logs a warning and saves the event in the highest priority queue.
10930	Waits for all threads in the `queues` list to complete by calling `join()` on each `QueueManager`'s `queueDispatcher`.
10931	Sets a property if not read-only and not filtered. Updates modifiedMap only if the value changes or is null.
10932	If the property is not in a read-only state and exists in either the authorizableMap or modifiedMap, it is marked for removal in the modifiedMap using a RemoveProperty object.
10933	Checks if the list is not in read-only mode and the principal is not already added; if so, adds the principal to the list and marks it as modified.
10934	Removes a principal if not in read-only mode and exits if principal is not found.
10935	Cleans up resources by removing packet and reader/writer listeners before window closes.
10936	Adds "NOT_INTERRUPT" descriptor, creates PresenceEvent with calculated fields, updates last seen and strict present status if present and known.
10937	This method updates presence and strict presence status based on event descriptors.
10938	Check if the resource in the ResourceModel is a Boolean and return its value, otherwise return false.
10939	Sets the name of a roster entry and updates all group names in the entry's roster packet before sending it to the connection.
10940	Checks if the hash table contains a key by comparing hashes and keys.
10941	The method checks if a given value is present in a data structure. If the value is null, it looks for null values in the entries. Otherwise, it uses a custom equality method to find the value.
10942	Inserts or updates a key-value pair in a hash table, returning the old value if the key already exists.
10943	Resets the hash table, increments modCount, clears each bucket, and sets size to 0.
10944	A hash function that modifies the hash code of an object to distribute it more evenly across possible hash codes.
10945	Compares two keys for equality, handling null values.
10946	Compares two objects for equality, using either reference equality or content equality.
10947	Ensures the hash table has enough capacity by resizing if needed, maintaining entries in the new array.
10948	Determines the new capacity by doubling the proposed capacity until it is greater than or equal to the proposed capacity, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum capacity.
10949	Returns an iterator over the entry set of the map, or an empty iterator if the map is empty.
10950	Loads object from binary stream, validates key and type, reads map from stream.
10951	Override register method to prepare, register content generator, event controller, output plugin, output extension, output controller, and activator, handling IllegalIDException for each.
10952	This method initializes an add-on by setting the context to a new instance of the provided context.
10953	Notifies reconnection listeners if reconnection is allowed.
10954	If reconnection is allowed, notify all connection listeners that a reconnection attempt will occur in a specified number of seconds.
