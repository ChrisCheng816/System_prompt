12226	Generates a list of newsgroups created on the server since the specified timestamp using the NEWGROUPS command.
The code defines a generator function `newgroups_gen` that takes a timestamp as input and yields a tuple containing the name, low water mark, high water mark, and status for each newsgroup created on the server since the specified timestamp.
The function first converts the input timestamp to GMT if it is naive (i.e., does not have a timezone). It then formats the timestamp as a string in the format specified by the NNTP protocol.
The function sends a NEWGROUPS command to the server with the formatted timestamp as an argument. If the server responds with a code of 231, indicating that the command was successful, the function yields a tuple containing the parsed information for each newsgroup returned by the server.
If the server responds with a code other than 231, the function raises a NNTPReplyError with the code and message provided by the server.
