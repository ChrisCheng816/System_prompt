This code snippet defines a method `calcFirstItemIndexOfPage` that calculates the starting index of the first item on a given page in a paged collection. The method takes a `PageRequest` object, which specifies the desired page number and page size, along with the total number of items in the collection. The result is the zero-based index of the first item in the specified page.

To understand this method, decompose it into smaller steps:

1. **Input Parameters:** The method takes three parameters:
   - `pageRequest`: An object containing the desired page number (`page`) and page size (`size`).
   - `total`: The total number of items in the collection.

2. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of this method is to determine the starting index of the first item on the specified page.

3. **Logic:**
   - The method calls another method `calcFirstItemIndexOfPage` with the page number (`pageRequest.getPage()`), page size (`pageRequest.getSize()`), and total number of items (`total`).

4. **Return Value:** The method returns the zero-based index of the first item in the specified page.

Here's the summary broken down into smaller parts:
- **Inputs:** `PageRequest` object, total number of items.
- **Purpose:** Calculate starting index of first item on a page.
- **Return Type:** Zero-based index of the first item.

Approach the breakdown step:
- **Inputs:** `PageRequest` object (`pageRequest`), total number of items (`total`).
- **Logic:** Retrieve page number and size from `pageRequest`, then calculate index.
- **Returns:** Zero-based index of first item.

In conclusion, the `calcFirstItemIndexOfPage` method is used to determine and return the starting index of the first item on a specific page based on the provided page number and total number of items in the collection.

9548	Builds a SQL query string based on provided criteria.
9549	Deletes a record by ID in the database.

The function `delete` is designed to remove a record from the database based on a provided ID. If the ID is not null, it uses the `getWritableDb` method to obtain a writable database connection, then it calls the `delete` method of the database handler `db`. The parameters passed to the `delete` method include the table name, the ID column name, a `?` placeholder for the ID value, and an array containing the actual ID value converted to a string. If the ID is null, the function returns 0, indicating no operation was performed.

The function effectively removes a record from the database if a valid ID is provided, ensuring that the data integrity is maintained.
