Note that this implementation also handles the case where `state` is a tuple containing two elements, the first of which is the state to restore that `inst` will be updated with and the second of which contains the state of the slots in `inst` that will be updated. If `inst` does not have a `__setstate__` method, this implementation falls back to directly updating the instance's `__dict__` with the `state` dictionary. If the `state` dictionary contains keys that are not valid attribute names for `inst`, this implementation will raise a `TypeError`. If the `state` dictionary contains duplicate keys, only the value corresponding to the last occurrence of the key will be retained. This implementation assumes that the values in `state` are compatible with the types of the corresponding attributes in `inst`.
