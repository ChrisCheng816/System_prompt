7212	As a language model AI, I do not have the ability to directly execute or interact with code. However, I can certainly provide a summary of the code based on the given input.
Here is a potential summary of the code:
This code defines a `match` function that takes a `request` object as an argument and returns a tuple containing a boolean value and a list of errors. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over all the matchers registered in the engine and calls the `match` method of each matcher on the `request`. If a matcher raises an exception, it catches the exception, appends an error message to the `errors` list, and returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The `all` function is used to determine if all the matchers passed.
