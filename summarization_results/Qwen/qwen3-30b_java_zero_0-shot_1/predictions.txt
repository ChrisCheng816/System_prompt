6	This method attempts to optimistically subscribe to a source Publisher using a mapper function when the source is a Callable that can produce a single value. If successful, it applies the mapper to get a Publisher of results and handles the case where that resulting Publisher is also a Callable that can produce a single result. In this optimized case, it uses a ScalarSubscription to deliver the single result directly. If the source is not a Callable or if the mapper doesn't produce a single-value Publisher, it returns false to indicate the optimization couldn't be applied.
7	Returns a Flowable that emits the result of applying a mapper function to a scalar value, with assembly notification enabled.
8	Resets all scheduler and assembly handlers to their default null states, and resets the failOnNonBlockingScheduler flag and onBeforeBlocking callback to their default values.

29	Returns the error if the value represents an error notification, otherwise returns null.
30	Validates the subscription relationship between upstream and next disposables, reporting double subscriptions if detected. Returns true if valid, false if upstream is already disposed.
31	Sets a disposable value atomically if not already set, otherwise disposes the new disposable and reports double subscription if needed. Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
32	Validates subscription by checking if upstream is null and handling double subscription cases. Returns false if upstream exists and double subscription is detected, otherwise returns true.
33	Sets the upstream subscription once, preventing subsequent subscriptions. Returns true if successful, false if already set. If already set, cancels the new subscription and reports double subscription.
34	Adds two long values with overflow protection, returning Long.MAX_VALUE if the result would be negative (indicating overflow).
35	This method performs multiplication with overflow protection. It multiplies two long integers and checks if the result would cause an overflow. If an overflow is detected (when both numbers are negative and the multiplication result is positive, or when the division check fails), it returns Long.MAX_VALUE instead of the overflowed result. Otherwise, it returns the normal multiplication result.
36	Adds a value to an AtomicLong with overflow protection, returning the original value if successful or Long.MAX_VALUE if the limit is reached.
37	Converts any Throwable into a NullPointerException with the original exception as its cause.
38	Adds an object to the collection, managing internal arrays with a hint for capacity. If the collection is empty, creates the first array. If the current tail array is full, creates a new tail array and links it. Otherwise, adds the object to the current tail array. Updates size and index tracking accordingly.
39	Shuts down the purge thread executor service and clears all pools.

46	Clears all resources by disposing them atomically, ensuring thread safety through synchronization and preventing double disposal.
47	Returns the number of disposables in the resource set, or 0 if the object has been disposed.
48	This method attempts to optimize subscription handling for observable sequences that can be evaluated immediately (callable sources). It checks if the source is a callable that can be executed synchronously, and if so, applies a mapper function to transform the value into an observable source. If the result is also callable, it retrieves the final value and subscribes immediately using a scalar disposable for better performance. Returns true if the optimization was applied, false otherwise.
49	Returns an Observable that applies a mapper function to a scalar value and flattens the result.
50	Accepts a subscriber and sequentially processes elements from a linked array structure, passing each element to the subscriber using NotificationLite.acceptFull. Returns true if the subscriber terminates early, false otherwise.

60	**Method Summary:**

`concatMapIterable` transforms each item emitted by the source Flowable into an Iterable, then concatenates these Iterables into a single Flowable sequence while preserving the order of items.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Backpressure Support:** FULL - Handles backpressure by buffering items
- **Scheduler Support:** NONE - Does not specify any thread scheduler
- **Return Type:** Flowable<U> - Emits items from the concatenated Iterables
- **Behavior:** Sequentially processes each item through the provided mapper function, which converts items to Iterables, then emits all items from these Iterables in order

207	Determines the target URL for redirection after successful authentication by delegating to the overloaded method that only takes request and response parameters.
208	Determines the target URL for redirection by checking: 1) if always use default is enabled, 2) if a target URL parameter is present in the request, 3) if referer header should be used, and 4) falls back to default target URL if none of the above conditions are met.
209	Sets the name of the request parameter that contains the target URL to redirect to after authentication. If a non-null value is provided, it must not be empty.
210	Returns a Directory object with its immediate parent populated by recursively fetching parent directories. Fetches directory data from database using jdbcTemplate and populates the directory hierarchy by calling itself recursively for non-root parents.

213	This method configures JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) login configuration by setting a security property with a login configuration URL. It first converts the login configuration to a URL and then searches for an existing property with the prefix "login.config.url." followed by an incrementing number (starting from 1) to find the next available slot. If the login config URL is not already set at any existing slot, it sets the property at the next available slot (n). If the URL already exists in an earlier slot, it skips setting the property to avoid duplicates.

The method uses a while loop to iterate through existing security properties with the specified prefix until it finds either:
1. An existing property with the same URL (already set)
2. An empty slot where it can set the property

This approach prevents duplicate configurations and ensures the JAAS login configuration is properly configured with the new URL.

221	Builds a distinguished name for a group by appending the group name as a lowercase value to the group search base using the group role attribute name.
222	When the maximum number of allowable sessions is exceeded, this method handles the situation based on the `exceptionIfMaximumExceeded` flag. If the flag is true or no sessions exist, it throws a `SessionAuthenticationException` with a message indicating the maximum session limit has been exceeded. Otherwise, it identifies the least recently used session from the provided list and expires it immediately, allowing the new session to be created while maintaining the session limit.

424	This method invokes a remote command with callback support and timeout handling. It creates an invoke future, adds it to the connection, and sends the request asynchronously. The method sets up a timeout task that triggers if the response isn't received within the specified time, and a send failure listener that handles network errors. It properly manages the invoke future lifecycle by removing it from the connection and executing callbacks appropriately when timeouts or send failures occur.
425	Sends a one-way remoting command asynchronously and logs errors if the operation fails or exceptions occur during sending.

431	Filters connections into service ON and OFF categories based on service status and connection completion state.
432	This method monitors connection pools and manages connection states based on thresholds. It iterates through connection pools, filters connections by service status, and when the number of active connections exceeds a threshold, it randomly selects a connection to be marked as inactive and closes previous connections. When connections fall below the threshold, it closes any stored connections and logs the status. It also closes any inactive connections that are still in good condition.
433	Closes the last select connection if its invoke future map is finished, otherwise waits and checks again. If still not finished, logs the address and skips closing. Connections that are eligible for closing are added to the serviceOffConnections list.

487	Method: decode
Summary: Decodes data from a ByteBuffer by first attempting to establish a WebSocket handshake, then processing frames. If the connection is already established (OPEN state), it directly decodes frames. If the connection is not yet established (NOT_YET_CONNECTED state), it attempts to decode a handshake and then processes any remaining data as frames. The method handles both socket buffer and temporary handshake bytes for frame decoding after successful handshake completion.
488	Closes the connection due to a wrong handshake by writing an HTTP error response and flushing/closing with the exception's close code and message.
489	Closes the connection due to an internal server error by writing a 500 HTTP response and flushing/closing the connection with a never connected status.

495	Sends a WebSocket handshake request by constructing the appropriate handshake headers and starting the handshake process with the server.
496	Sets the connection lost timeout value and manages the connection lost timer accordingly. If timeout is <= 0, stops the timer. Otherwise, if websocket is running, resets all ping timers and restarts the connection lost timer.
497	Stops the connection lost timer by synchronizing access to the connection lost monitoring mechanism, setting the websocket status to not running, and canceling the connection lost timer if it's currently active.
498	Starts the connection lost timer if timeout is active, otherwise deactivates it.
499	Restarts the connection lost timer by cancelling the existing timer, creating a new single-thread scheduled executor, and scheduling a connection lost checker task that periodically validates connections and detects lost connections based on pong timeouts.
500	This method executes connection lost detection for a WebSocket connection by:

1. Validating that the WebSocket is a WebSocketImpl instance
2. Checking if the last pong time is older than the minimum allowed pong time
3. If no pong was received in time, closing the connection with an abnormal close code and a descriptive message
4. If pong time is acceptable, sending a ping message if the connection is open, or logging a trace message if the connection is not open

The method implements lost connection detection by monitoring pong responses and automatically closing connections that fail to respond in a timely manner.
501	Cancels the connection lost timer by shutting down the checker service and canceling the checker future.
502	Overrides the server websocket handshake handling to return a new HandshakeImpl1Server instance.
503	When a WebSocket ping frame is received, this method responds by sending back a pong frame with the same data.
504	Stops the WebSocket server by closing all connections and shutting down the selector thread.

Closes each WebSocket connection with a GOING_AWAY code, closes the WebSocket factory, and finally joins the selector thread with the specified timeout to ensure proper shutdown.
505	Returns the port number of the address, or the local port of the server socket if the address port is 0 and server is available.
506	Reads additional data from channels in the queue and processes the data into input buffers.
507	Handles incoming socket connections by accepting the connection, configuring the channel, creating a WebSocket implementation, registering it with the selector, and setting up necessary socket options. If any errors occur during setup, it properly cleans up resources and handles the exception.
508	Reads data from a socket channel into a buffer, handles the data through the connection's input queue, and manages buffer recycling and channel state. Returns true if successful, false if channel is closed.
509	Writes data to the socket channel in batch mode and updates the selection key to read only if the write operation was successful.
510	Sets up the selector and server thread for WebSocket communication, including opening and configuring the server socket, initializing the selector, starting connection timeout timer, launching decoder threads, and calling the start callback method. Returns false if an I/O error occurs during setup, otherwise returns true.
511	Method `doEnsureSingleThread` ensures thread safety by synchronizing access to a shared resource. It checks if the current instance has already been started by verifying if `selectorthread` is not null. If it has been started, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. Otherwise, it sets the current thread as the `selectorthread` and returns `false` if the instance is closed, otherwise `true`. The method guarantees that the instance can only be started once and handles the closed state appropriately.
512	Shuts down the WebSocket server by stopping the connection lost timer, interrupting all decoder workers, closing the selector, and closing the server socket. Any IOExceptions during closing operations are logged and passed to the onError handler.
513	Returns the underlying Socket object from a WebSocket connection by extracting it from the associated SocketChannel.
514	Broadcasts byte array data to a collection of WebSocket clients. Throws IllegalArgumentException if data or clients is null. Uses ByteBuffer to wrap the data before broadcasting.
515	Broadcasts a message to multiple WebSocket clients. Throws IllegalArgumentException if text or clients is null. Uses doBroadcast method to perform the actual broadcasting operation.
516	Broadcasts data to multiple WebSocket clients by converting the data to appropriate frames based on each client's draft protocol and sending them individually. Handles both String and ByteBuffer data types, with proper null checking and exception handling for disconnected clients.
517	Fills a map with frames created from draft data, only if the draft is not already present in the map. The method creates frames from either string data or binary data using the draft's createFrames method, and stores them in the draftFrames map with the draft as key.
518	Transfers data from a source ByteBuffer to a destination ByteBuffer, returning the number of bytes actually transferred. The method handles cases where the source has more remaining bytes than the destination can accept by limiting the transfer to the destination's remaining capacity.

537	Deprecated method that delegates to the call(Request) method, adding context arguments to the request attributes if they exist.
538	This method handles HTTP request processing by managing application context. It first checks if a context exists in thread local storage, and if so, reuses it with the current request. If no context exists, it creates a new one. The method removes context arguments from the request, sets up the appropriate context, and delegates to the abstract `call(Context)` method for actual request processing. The result is returned as a CompletionStage containing the Result.

1054	Method Summary: end()

This method finalizes the DOM tree construction by closing any unclosed tags, processing whitespace removal, applying foster rules, and recording completion timing. It performs the following operations:

1. Validates and closes any unclosed HTML tags by traversing up the parent node hierarchy from the current parent node to the root node, logging warnings for unclosed tags when implied end tags are enabled
2. Removes trailing whitespace text nodes when configured to ignore whitespaces between tags
3. Applies foster element rules to properly handle HTML elements that should be fostered according to HTML specification when configured
4. Marks the root node as finished and logs the total elapsed time for DOM tree creation

The method ensures proper HTML structure validation and cleanup upon completion of parsing.
1055	Creates an Element node with appropriate void tag handling based on HTML rules and configuration settings.
1056	This method processes HTML tags during DOM building by handling three tag types: START, END, and SELF_CLOSING. For START tags, it creates element nodes, handles implied end tags, and manages parent node hierarchy. For END tags, it matches closing tags with opening ones, implicitly closes tags when needed, and fixes unclosed tags. For SELF_CLOSING tags, it creates and adds nodes directly. The method also handles whitespace management and logging of implicit tag closures.
1057	Removes the last child node from a parent node if it is an empty text node. Returns immediately if the parent node is null, has no children, or if the last child is not a text node. For closed tags, it also checks that the parent has more than one child before removing. If the text node is blank, it detaches the node from its parent.

2336	Returns true if the character at the given position in the string is escaped by a backslash, false otherwise. Counts the number of consecutive backslashes before the position - if odd, the last backslash escapes the character.
2337	This method determines whether a given position in a string is inside a character class (bracket expression) of a regular expression. It returns true if the position is within an unclosed character class bracket pair, and false otherwise.

The method works by:
1. Finding the most recent non-escaped opening bracket '[' before the given position
2. If found, searching forward from that opening bracket to find a corresponding closing bracket ']'
3. Returning true only if an opening bracket was found but no matching closing bracket exists before the current position
4. Accounting for escaped brackets by using an auxiliary `isEscapedChar` method

This is useful for regex parsing to understand the context of special characters within character classes.
2338	Counts the number of non-escaped, non-character-class opening parentheses in a string up to a given position.
2339	Extracts group information from a named pattern string, returning a map where keys are group names and values are lists of GroupInfo objects containing group indices and positions.
2340	Replaces all non-escaped matches of a regex pattern in a StringBuilder with a replacement string, returning the modified StringBuilder.
2341	This method handles GET requests to provide JSON or JSONP formatted MBean data. It supports two query modes: querying specific MBean attributes using a "get" parameter in format "objectName::attributeName", or querying all MBeans matching a pattern using a "qry" parameter (defaulting to "*:*"). The response is formatted as JSON by default, or JSONP if a "callback" parameter is provided. The method properly handles request parameters, generates appropriate JSON structure, and manages resources including JSON generator and output writer with proper cleanup. Error handling is implemented for invalid queries and I/O issues.
2342	Refreshes the schema for a given table if the schema is outdated based on the SCN (System Change Number) value, updating the schema cache and last update timestamp. Returns true if the schema was refreshed, false otherwise.

Handles various part types including HOST, PLUGIN, MESSAGE, TIME_HIRES, INTERVAL_HIRES, TIME, INTERVAL, SEVERITY, VALUES, SIGNATURE, and ENCRYPTION, with appropriate parsing, validation, and field creation. Returns the updated offset after processing the part.
2349	Parses a sequence of values from a ByteBuf starting at the given offset. Reads the number of values, then processes each value based on its data type (COUNTER, GAUGE, DERIVE, ABSOLUTE), extracting the appropriate data and storing it in fields with corresponding labels.

2609	Extracts database dialects from SQL properties by parsing the dot-separated keys and adding the substring after the first dot to the databaseDialects collection.
2610	This method investigates and identifies the database dialect by:

1. Attempting to detect the dialect from database metadata when no dialect is configured
2. First trying the database product name, then falling back to the driver name if needed
3. Logging debug information about the detection process
4. Handling exceptions gracefully and ensuring connection cleanup
5. If no dialect is found automatically, logging a failure message
6. If a dialect is configured, validating and adjusting it to ensure compatibility
7. Logging debug information about the configured vs. actual dialect values

The method uses database metadata to guess the correct dialect when not explicitly configured, with fallback mechanisms and comprehensive logging.
2611	Method that identifies and unifies database dialect names from input strings by checking for specific keywords and returning standardized dialect names.
2612	Checks if the timer database table exists by executing a load timer query. If the query fails (indicating the table doesn't exist), it attempts to create the table using SQL statements. Also verifies transaction isolation level and handles resource cleanup in finally block.

2620	Begins the creation of an SFSB (Session Facade Stateful Bean) by managing the nesting level and tracking structures for extended entity managers and injected XPCs (Extended Persistence Contexts). When the nesting level is zero (top-level creation), it initializes new tracking structures. For nested creations, it creates new tracking structures based on the parent's tracking structure. The method increments the creation bean nesting level after setting up the appropriate tracking context.
2621	Method: endSfsbCreation

Summary: Ends the creation process of an SFSB (Session Facade Stateful Bean) by decrementing the nesting level counter. When the top-level bean creation is complete (nesting level reaches 0), it clears the XPC (eXtended Persistence Context) creation tracking data from the thread-local storage. Otherwise, when creating sub-beans, it switches the XPC creation tracking to the parent level by referencing the parent's XPC tracking data. This method manages the hierarchical tracking of XPC creation during nested bean creation processes.
2622	Returns the current SFSB call stack invocation map, or null if the stack is empty or null.
2623	Pushes entity managers onto the current SFSB call stack and associates them with the current JTA transaction if needed.

2694	Returns a set containing all container interceptors, including class-level, default (if not excluded), and method-level interceptors, initializing it lazily if needed.
2695	This method determines whether a given method should be treated as method-level by checking various configuration levels in a specific order. It first resolves the actual method and extracts its parameter types and name. Then it checks multiple style configurations (perViewStyle1-3 and style1-3) for matches based on method interface, method name, and parameter types. If no match is found at any level, it falls back to checking the default method interface recursively. The method returns true if the method is found at a method-level configuration, false otherwise.

2711	Instantiates a bean using the provided configuration and metadata. The method first checks for constructor configuration, handling both regular constructors and factory methods (static or instance). If a factory class or factory config is specified, it creates the appropriate joinpoint for factory-based instantiation. If no factory is specified, it falls back to using the bean's constructor directly. Finally, it dispatches the joinpoint to create and return the instantiated bean object.
2712	Configures bean properties by iterating through PropertyConfig objects, applying configuration to the bean. If a property configuration fails and nullify is false, it attempts to nullify previously configured properties before throwing a StartException.

2734	Sets annotation indexes for persistence units by collecting indexes from all resource roots in the deployment unit hierarchy and attaching them to each persistence unit metadata.
2735	Returns a persistence provider adaptor based on the provided parameters, first checking for an adapter in the deployment holder, then attempting to load one from the deployment unit or module, and finally creating a new one if needed. Throws DeploymentUnitProcessingException if the adapter cannot be loaded.
2736	Save a persistence provider adaptor for a deployment unit, returning the adaptor that was actually saved (either the provided one or an existing one if another thread already saved it).
2737	**Summary:**

The `lookupProvider` method is responsible for locating and returning a `PersistenceProvider` instance based on the provided persistence unit metadata and deployment context. It first checks if a provider is already associated with the deployment unit. If not, it attempts to load the provider from a specified module or defaults to a configured provider class. The method handles different scenarios including application-supplied providers, module-based loading, and fallbacks based on provider class names. If no suitable provider is found, it throws an exception indicating the provider could not be located.

2742	Method `getAnalysis` retrieves or creates a `ContainerAnalysis` for a given class, using a synchronized approach to handle concurrent access. It first checks if analysis is already available or in progress to avoid duplication. If not found, it creates a work-in-progress entry, performs the analysis work, and then marks it as complete. The method ensures thread safety through synchronization and handles potential deadlocks by not waiting for other threads. It also tracks classes by their classloaders for memory management purposes.
2743	Returns the ContainerAnalysis object from workDone map using the given class as key, or null if not found. Removes the map entry if the stored SoftReference has been cleared.

2747	Converts a long integer to a 16-character uppercase hexadecimal string, padding with leading zeros if necessary.
2748	Returns true if the method is a valid getter accessor method (starts with "get" or "is", has no parameters, non-void return type, and proper exception handling).
2749	Returns true if the given method is a mutator (setter) method, meaning it starts with "set", has void return type, exactly one parameter, and has non-application exceptions.
2750	Returns true if all exceptions declared in the method are assignable from RemoteException, false otherwise.
2751	Removes getter/setter prefix ("get" or "is") from attribute names, throwing an exception for invalid accessors.
2752	Returns the attribute name by removing the "set" prefix from setter method names, throws exception for non-setter methods.
2753	Method `fixupOverloadedOperationNames` processes overloaded Java methods to generate unique IDL names by analyzing method parameters and constructing descriptive IDL names that avoid naming conflicts. It iterates through methods marked as overloaded, finds corresponding operation analyses, and modifies their IDL names by appending parameter type information while handling IDL identifier escaping rules. The method ensures each overloaded operation has a unique IDL name by incorporating parameter type details into the naming convention.
2754	This method resolves naming conflicts in IDL (Interface Definition Language) names by analyzing contained entries and appending suffixes to prevent case-insensitive collisions. It first identifies entries with duplicate names (ignoring case) by comparing uppercased names, then for each conflicting entry, it modifies the name by appending underscores and position indices of uppercase letters to create unique identifiers.
2755	Escapes special characters in an IR (Intermediate Representation) name by converting non-ASCII characters to Unicode escape sequences. For each character in the input string, if the character is in the ASCII range (0-255), it is appended directly to the result. If the character is outside this range, it is converted to a Unicode escape sequence in the format "\\U" followed by the hexadecimal representation of the character's code point. Returns the escaped string.
2756	Parses the XTS environment element from XML, handling URL attribute and ensuring no content exists.
2757	Parses the default context propagation element from XML configuration, handling only the 'enabled' attribute and validating its boolean value, then sets the parameter on the subsystem model node while ensuring no child elements exist.

2761	Deploys EJB-related module dependencies to the deployment unit, including EE API, EJB client libraries, and IIOP dependencies when required, while ensuring proper module specification configuration for EJB and application client deployments.
2762	Writes an attribute to XML output if it's marshallable, starting a new element if necessary.
2763	Returns the MethodIntf associated with the given InterceptorContext. For timer invocations, the method interface is retrieved directly from the context's private data. For other invocations, it attempts to get the method interface from the component view's private data, defaulting to MethodIntf.BEAN if neither source contains it.
2764	Creates a new session by either directly creating it or through a control point if available. If a control point exists, it begins a request, handles rejection cases, and ensures proper cleanup. Throws appropriate exceptions for container suspension, component unavailability, or other failures.

2907	Cancels the operation and returns true if the cancellation was successful. The method handles different states of the operation (waiting, cancelled, cancelled with flag, started, started with flag) and updates the state accordingly. If setFlag is true, it sets additional flags during cancellation. Returns false if the operation cannot be cancelled from its current state.
2908	Runs the operation if it has not been cancelled, transitioning from WAITING to STARTED state. Returns true if execution proceeds, false if cancelled. Throws unreachable code exception if state is invalid.

2918	Method: findRecord
Purpose: Retrieves a record from the cache using the provided ORID (Object Record Identifier)
Parameters: rid - The ORID of the record to find
Returns: The record if found in the cache, otherwise null

2923	Returns true if the given ORid's cluster is contained in the filterClusters set, false otherwise. Throws IllegalArgumentException if filterClusters is null. Gets the cluster name from the database using the rid's cluster ID and checks if it exists in the filterClusters set.
2924	This method attempts to optimize query execution by using indexes for sorting operations. It checks if a class exists in the schema, then examines all indexes associated with that class to find one that supports ordered iterations and has sufficient fields to cover the ORDER BY clause. If a suitable index is found, it adds steps to fetch data from the index values and retrieve values from index entries, applying the appropriate sort order. The method returns true if an index was successfully used for sorting, or false otherwise. The optimization only applies when all ORDER BY items use the same sort direction (all ASC or all DESC) and when the index fields match the query's ORDER BY fields.
2925	**Summary:** Checks if a class hierarchy contains a diamond pattern by detecting cycles in the subclass relationship graph using breadth-first traversal. Returns `true` if a diamond hierarchy is detected, `false` otherwise.

**Method Signature:** `private boolean isDiamondHierarchy(OClass clazz)`

**Parameters:** 
- `clazz`: The starting class to check for diamond hierarchy

**Returns:** 
- `boolean`: `true` if diamond hierarchy (cycle) exists, `false` if no cycle detected

**Logic:** Uses a queue-based traversal to explore all subclasses, tracking visited classes to detect when a subclass is encountered again (indicating a diamond pattern), and returns immediately upon detection.
2926	Returns the order direction (ascending or descending) for a query based on the order by items in QueryPlanningInfo. Returns null if there are mixed order types or no order by clause. Returns true for ascending order, false for descending order.
2927	Returns true if the key condition requires multiple index lookups, false otherwise. Checks if any sub-block in the OAndBlock is not an OBinaryCondition, which would require multiple index lookups.
2928	Method finds the best index for a given query block by evaluating all valid indexes on a class, filtering and ranking them by cost and field count, and returning the most efficient index descriptor.
2929	Builds an index search descriptor for fulltext queries by extracting text search conditions that match index fields and creating a key condition for index lookup. Returns null if no matching conditions found or if partial key matches are not supported by the index type.
2930	Groups index search descriptors by index and conditions, then aggregates remaining conditions into OR blocks for efficient indexing.
2931	Creates and returns an ODocumentFieldHandlingStrategy instance based on the specified strategy code. If a strategy with the given code is already registered, it returns the registered instance. Otherwise, it creates a new strategy instance with appropriate type handling strategies for binary data types (BINARY) based on the strategy code (SINGLE_ORECORD_BYTES, SPLIT_ORECORD_BYTES, or SIMPLE default). The created strategy is then registered and returned.
2932	Method `allow` checks if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific operation on a given resource. It first validates that the user has roles defined, throwing a security exception if not. Then it verifies if the user's roles allow the requested operation on the specified resource. If permission is granted, it returns the role that provided the permission; otherwise, it throws an `OSecurityAccessException` with details about the denied operation.
2933	Checks if a rule is defined for the given resource generic and specific values by iterating through all roles and returning true if any role has the specified rule, false otherwise.
2934	Returns a compact string representation of the distributed server status, including member count, server names, statuses, and database information for each member.
2935	Initializes the system database by loading the default configuration, disabling auto-deployment, creating a modifiable distributed configuration, removing the "<NEW_NODE>" server entry, registering the system database with the message service, and adding the local node to the server list.
2936	Loads and initializes local databases on the distributed server, registering each database with the message service and handling cluster ownership reassignment if needed.
2937	Method `memberRemoved` handles membership events when a cluster member leaves. It updates the last cluster change timestamp, retrieves the name of the leaving member, and removes the server from the cluster. The method includes error handling for Hazelcast instance not active scenarios and other exceptions, logging appropriate error messages when servers cannot be removed.
2938	Elects a new lock manager server in a distributed Hazelcast-based system. The method attempts to select the next available active server from a registered list to serve as the new lock manager, ensuring only one lock manager is active at any time. It uses a distributed lock to coordinate the election process and handles cases where the current lock manager is unreachable or inactive. The method returns the name of the newly elected lock manager server or null if no suitable server is found.
2939	Assigns the lock manager server from the cluster by checking active nodes and handling election scenarios. If only the current node is online, it becomes the lock manager. If the lock manager was previously the current node but is now offline, it forces a new election. Otherwise, it uses the existing lock manager or waits briefly before retrying. Finally, it sets the lock manager server and logs the result.
2940	Commits a micro-transaction by decrementing the level and performing the actual commit when the level reaches zero. Throws exceptions for inactive or unbalanced transactions.
2941	Rolls back a micro-transaction, throwing exceptions for inactive or unbalanced transactions. Decrements the transaction level and performs rollback when level reaches zero.
2942	Updates the identity of a record after a commit, handling index key dependencies and ensuring transactional consistency by reinserting affected index entries.
2943	Deletes all records from the local cache that were modified by the current transaction, effectively rolling back the cache to its state before the transaction began.
2944	Method `prepareForFileCreationOrReplacement` prepares a file path for creation or replacement by:
1. Deleting any existing file at the specified path and logging a warning if successful
2. Creating all necessary parent directories for the path if they don't already exist

The method takes a `Path` object, an `Object` requester for logging purposes, and a `String` operation description for the log message. It throws `IOException` if directory creation fails.
2945	Performs an atomic file move operation from source to target, falling back to a regular move if atomic move is not supported.
2946	Returns a list of disjoint patterns by grouping connected pattern nodes into separate patterns based on their connections. The method traverses the graph of pattern nodes, starting from unvisited nodes and collecting all connected nodes into individual patterns until all nodes are processed. Each pattern contains aliases mapped to their corresponding pattern nodes, and the number of edges is recalculated for each pattern.

1. Finding the maximum ordinal value from pointersAndOrdinals array
2. Creating a new long array pointersByOrdinal with size maxOrdinal + 1
3. Initializing all elements of pointersByOrdinal with -1
4. Populating pointersByOrdinal with pointer values extracted from pointersAndOrdinals by masking off the ordinal bits
5. Setting the ordinal bits of each key to zero, so that the remaining value is just the pointer itself

The method essentially reorganizes data from a combined pointer-ordinal format into a separate ordinal-indexed array of pointers, which appears to be part of a hash table implementation where buckets are stored as key-value pairs with ordinals.
3422	Compares a serialized representation with data at a given position in byteData. Returns true if the serialized data matches the byteData at the specified key position, false otherwise.

2. Each of the input values (val0-val6) is masked to 4 bits using & 0xf and shifted to progressively lower 4-bit positions:
   - val0 is placed in bits 24-27
   - val1 is placed in bits 20-23
   - val2 is placed in bits 16-19
   - val3 is placed in bits 12-15
   - val4 is placed in bits 8-11
   - val5 is placed in bits 4-7
   - val6 is placed in bits 0-3

Parameters: int array named block
Purpose: Applies the div() function to every fourth element of the block array, processing 64 elements in groups of 4 starting from index 0. The method iterates through the array with a step of 4 and calls div() on each of the four elements in the current group, effectively transforming all elements at indices 0, 4, 8, ..., 60 and 1, 5, 9, ..., 61 and 2, 6, 10, ..., 62 and 3, 7, 11, ..., 63.
3641	Concatenates the bits from another BitsBuffer to this buffer by appending the bits and updating the length. Handles bit shifting and merging between two 64-bit buffers, accounting for cases where the total length exceeds 32 bits.
3642	This method performs a reverse bit manipulation operation on a 32-bit integer. It applies a series of bitwise operations with shift and mask constants (S[i] and B[i]) to scramble the bits, then shifts the result to remove low bits based on the specified length. The operation appears to be part of a reversible bit manipulation algorithm, likely for cryptographic or hash functions, where the original value can be restored by applying the inverse operation (as suggested by the "rewind" naming convention).
3643	Rewinds and reverses a 64-bit value split into high and low 32-bit parts, returning the result in an array. If length <= 32, it only processes the low part. For lengths > 32, it applies multiple bit rotations using pre-defined shift and mask arrays, then extracts the appropriate bits to form the result.

It handles two cases: when the library is already on the file system (returns immediately if not found) and when it's packaged inside a JAR file (unpacks to a temporary location). For JAR-contained libraries, it creates a temporary file, writes the library content from the JAR to that file, loads the library using JNI, and then cleans up the temporary file. The method returns true if successful, false otherwise.

Returns: index of next separator character, or -1 if not found

Description: This method searches through a string starting from a given position to find the next occurrence of a separator character, while properly handling escaped separators. It processes each character in the string, counting escape sequences and appending non-separator characters to the provided StringBuilder. When it encounters an unescaped separator, it returns the current index. If no separator is found, it returns -1. The escape sequence handling works by counting consecutive escape characters and only treating a separator as actual separator when not preceded by an odd number of escape characters.

The method supports INT, FLOAT, and DOUBLE buffer types, reading from a source buffer at calculated offsets based on fromStride and writing to a destination buffer at calculated offsets based on toStride. It uses native byte order for all operations and throws an IllegalArgumentException for unsupported buffer types. The TODO comment indicates that shape copy functionality needs to be implemented for cases where stride equals 1.

When the current iteration is exhausted and the maximum number of passes hasn't been reached, it increments the pass counter, resets the iterator, logs the new epoch, and resets the batch counter. It then increments the batch counter, retrieves the next dataset from the iterator, applies any preprocessing if configured, and returns the processed dataset.
3856	This method computes the QR decomposition of a matrix using LAPACK's sgeqrf and sorgqr routines. It takes an input matrix A and decomposes it into Q (orthogonal matrix) and R (upper triangular matrix) components. The method:

2. Copies the upper triangular part of the result into the R matrix, zeroing out the lower triangular part
3. Calls sorgqr to generate the orthogonal matrix Q from the Householder reflectors
4. Handles error checking with BlasException if LAPACK routines fail
The method modifies the input matrix A in-place to contain the QR decomposition and optionally returns the R matrix if provided.

4042	Empties cache entries for the given keys by marking them as null in the memcache, but only for keys that are cacheable according to the cache control policy.
4043	Method `cachePutIfUntouched` attempts to conditionally cache multiple buckets using a "put if untouched" strategy. It processes each bucket to check if it's cacheable and has a valid expiry time. Valid buckets are prepared for caching with their values and expiry settings, while invalid buckets are immediately marked as successful. The method then performs the actual cache operation and returns the set of all successfully processed buckets.
4044	Retrieves multiple values from memcache by their keys. If a serialization error occurs during retrieval, it logs the error, deletes the problematic keys from memcache, and returns an empty map.
4045	Returns a Set containing all the keys from the given collection of buckets by mapping each bucket to its key.

4050	Registers a subclass translator by traversing up the class hierarchy, creating super translators and establishing subclass relationships until reaching Object.class.
4051	Checks if two types could have a common subtype by comparing their erased classes. Returns true if they are both classes and one is assignable from the other, or if at least one is an interface. Uses an optimistic approach and doesn't fully verify generic type parameters.
4052	Transforms the owner type of an inner class to match its declaring class, handling type parameters appropriately. If the given owner is null, it returns the declaring class. If the owner is not a supertype of the declaring class, it throws an exception. For static inner classes, it erases type parameters from the transformed owner, while for non-static inner classes, it returns the transformed owner with type parameters preserved.

4428	Method Summary:
`makeCoordinateSystemsMaximal` analyzes variables in a NetcdfDataset to assign or create maximal coordinate systems. It examines each variable that doesn't already have a coordinate system and finds matching coordinate axes. If a complete coordinate system exists or can be built, it assigns it to the variable. The method respects the dataset's enhance mode to determine whether incomplete coordinate systems are acceptable. The process involves finding existing coordinate systems by name, checking completeness based on the enhance mode, and creating new implicit coordinate systems when appropriate. It logs information about assigned or created coordinate systems for each variable.

Key behaviors:
- Only processes variables without existing coordinate systems that are data variables
- Finds coordinate axes matching each variable
- Checks if coordinate systems are complete based on enhance mode settings
- Assigns existing complete coordinate systems or creates new implicit ones
- Logs coordinate system assignments/creations with variable names
- Respects `NetcdfDataset.Enhance.IncompleteCoordSystems` setting

4432	Filters the dataset using the provided filter, marks the filtered results, deletes the filtered items from the top dataset, and updates the current filter.
4433	Method `mark` recursively traverses an dataset hierarchy to mark datasets for deletion based on a filter criteria. It first checks if the current dataset is a catalog reference and if it's readable. Then it recursively processes nested datasets, returning false if any nested dataset fails to mark. If all nested datasets are processed successfully, it applies the filter to determine if the current dataset should be marked for deletion (returns false if filter accepts it). Finally, it marks the dataset for deletion and returns true.

4556	Creates and returns a new Dataset instance with the specified parameters, overriding the default implementation in OuterDim and tiled datasets.
4557	Summary: The `putResourceControl` method stores resource control information for a dataset by mapping its URL path to access restrictions. It logs the operation when debug is enabled, adds the dataset's URL path and access restrictions to a hash map, and sets a flag indicating that resource control exists. The method includes commented-out logic for handling DatasetScan and InvDatasetFmrc types with path matching, but currently only uses exact path matching for regular datasets.

4. MatchPattern is not null when type is REGULAR_EXPRESSION

Returns true if all validations pass, false otherwise. Appends validation error messages to the provided StringBuilder output.
4562	This method checks if a given dataset matches the filter criteria. It first validates whether the filter applies to the dataset type (collection vs atomic), then determines the appropriate field to match against (name or URL path). For regular expression matching, it applies the pattern to the selected field and returns whether there's a match. The method handles both collection and atomic datasets with different default matching targets and throws a warning for unsupported filter types.

The method iterates through all clauses retrieved by `getClauses()`, executing each one until either all clauses are processed or one returns false, at which point it stops and returns the final result. If debugging is enabled, it prints each clause being evaluated. Returns true if all clauses evaluate to true, false otherwise.
4566	Prints constraint clauses joined by " & " separators to the specified PrintWriter.
4567	static public boolean amendFromODL(NetcdfFile ncfile, Group eosGroup) throws IOException {

4569	Method `checkUnknownDims` checks if a dimension name exists in a list of unknown dimensions. If found, it sets the dimension's length to match an existing dimension, marks it as unlimited if length is 0, adds it to its parent group, removes it from the unknown dimensions list, logs a warning, and returns the dimension. Returns null if no matching dimension is found.
4570	Finds a group with the specified name within the given parent group and its nested groups recursively. Returns the first matching group found or null if not found.

4579	Returns true if the coordinate system has all three required axes (azimuth, radial, and elevation) for radial coordinate system representation.
4580	Returns the maximum radial value cached in kilometers, calculating it only once if not already computed. The method retrieves radial data, finds its maximum, and converts the result from its original units to kilometers. IOException and IllegalArgumentException are caught and printed to stderr, but do not propagate.
4581	Opens a URL connection using the specified command (GET/HEAD), sends the request, and displays the response headers and content. Handles URL parsing exceptions and I/O exceptions.

2. Sets first element using linear extrapolation: 1.5 × array[0] - 0.5 × array[1]
3. Sets last element using linear extrapolation: 1.5 × array[n-1] - 0.5 × array[n-2]
4. Sets inner elements using simple average: 0.5 × (array[i-1] + array[i])

**Input:** double[] array - the input array to process
**Output:** double[] - new array with extrapolated/interpolated values

4621	Returns the STN file path by searching up the directory tree from the given location. First checks the parent directory of the location, then if not found, checks the grandparent directory. Returns null if STN file cannot be found in either location.
4622	Opens the IGRA station data file, initializes file handles based on file extension (.idx or .dat), sets up NetCDF structure information for station, time series, and profile data, and populates NetCDF file with NcML configuration.
4623	Returns the beginning position of a node at the specified index, either using a cached value if the index follows sequentially or calculating it by summing node counts from previous indices.

4628	Converts Earth-Centered Fixed (ECF) coordinates to Geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude).

This method takes ECF Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and ellipsoid parameters (a, b) to calculate geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude. It uses iterative mathematical formulas to transform from the Earth-centered coordinate system to the Earth-fixed geodetic coordinate system, applying corrections for Earth's ellipsoidal shape through the first eccentricity squared and flattening calculations. The longitude is normalized to the range [-π, π].
4629	Removes or transforms units based on specific rules: returns empty string for "Proportion"/"Numeric" or "-" units, converts "degree...true" units to use underscores, and processes other units by trimming, removing special characters, and replacing spaces/special characters with dots, while preserving units containing " table ".

4636	Method `findDataV` recursively searches for a DodsV object by traversing up the parent chain and then searching within the parent's children. If a parent exists, it recursively calls itself on the parent and then searches for the child with the same encoded name. If no parent exists, it directly searches for the DodsV with the given encoded name. It returns the found DodsV object or null if not found.
4637	Returns the child node at the specified index, or null if the index is out of bounds.
4638	Returns the parent Group of this object, initializing it to the root group if it's null. Gets the parent group from the superclass, and if null, sets and returns the netCDF file's root group as the parent.

4640	Returns the index of the dimension with the specified short name, or -1 if not found.
4641	Returns the units string value from the attribute list, searching case-sensitively first then case-insensitively, or null if not found.
4642	Returns the shape of this variable as a Section object, creating it lazily if necessary. The Section is constructed from the dimensions of this variable, where each dimension contributes a Range based on its length (positive length creates a named range, zero length creates an empty range, and negative length creates a vlen range). The resulting Section is made immutable and cached for future calls. Throws IllegalStateException if there are invalid ranges in the dimensions.
4643	Creates a slice of this variable along the specified dimension at the given value, returning a new variable with reduced rank. Throws InvalidRangeException if the dimension or slice value is invalid. The sliced variable shares the same data but with one less dimension and uses a proxy reader to access the appropriate subset of data.

4653	Reset the shape array by iterating through dimensions and setting each dimension's length. Also checks for variable-length dimensions and invalid unlimited dimension configurations. Clears the cached shapeAsSection field.
4654	Sets the dimensions of this variable using a dimension string. Throws IllegalStateException if the variable is immutable, or IllegalArgumentException if dimension parsing fails. Resets the shape after successfully setting dimensions.
4655	Reset the dimensions by creating new dimension objects from the parent group for shared dimensions, while keeping non-shared dimensions unchanged, then reset the shape. Throws IllegalStateException if the object is immutable or IllegalArgumentException if a shared dimension cannot be found in the parent group.
4656	Sets the dimension at the specified index to the given dimension object, throws IllegalStateException if the object is immutable, and resets the shape afterwards.
4657	Sets the cached data for this variable, validating that the data type is compatible with the variable's data type, and marks the cache as active.
4658	Returns a list containing all dimensions by recursively collecting them from the current object and its nested structures.
4659	Sets the bounding box by iterating through all coordinate systems, updating their origin, and extending the largest bounding box with each system's bounding box.

4669	Scans a BUFR file and processes each message, returning the total count of processed messages. For each message, it displays header information if enabled, processes the message as a dataset, and accumulates counts. Exceptions during processing are caught and displayed, but do not stop the overall scanning process.
4670	Processes a BUFR message as a dataset by opening it as a NetcdfFile, extracting observation data, and processing the sequence data.
4671	Handles POST requests for file uploads, validates multipart content, processes uploaded files with optional XML output, and handles errors appropriately.

4676	Method Summary:
```
pan(double deltax, double deltay)
```

Moves the current view by the specified horizontal and vertical distances. Adjusts the origin coordinates (pix_x0, pix_y0) by the given deltas and triggers a map area event to reflect the new view position. Uses a zoom stack to preserve the current zoom state during the operation.
4677	Method zoom() performs a zoom operation on a graphical display by adjusting pixel coordinates and scaling based on the provided rectangle dimensions. It includes debug output when enabled, validates minimum dimensions, saves the current zoom state, and updates the viewport center and scale factor. The method returns early if width or height is less than 5 pixels.
4678	Recalculates navigation parameters based on bounding box dimensions. Determines the limiting dimension (width or height) to set pixel-to-world scale factor, then calculates center point and offset values for coordinate transformation. Uses the minimum of x and y scaling factors to maintain aspect ratio, with debug output option for tracing calculations.
4679	Adds a listener to the listeners list if it's not already present, otherwise logs a warning. Returns immediately if the listener is already registered.
4680	Removes a listener from the listener list if present, updates the hasListeners flag, and logs a warning if the listener is not found.
4681	Sends an event to all registered listeners synchronously. If no listeners exist or the manager is disabled, the method returns immediately. For each listener, it invokes the configured method with the event as argument. If an exception occurs during method invocation, it logs the error and removes the problematic listener. If an InvocationTargetException is thrown, it wraps the cause in a RuntimeException and rethrows it to the caller.
4682	Sends an event to all registered listeners except the event source. This method is synchronized and performs the following steps:
1. Checks if there are listeners and if the manager is enabled
2. Creates an argument array containing the event
3. Iterates through all listeners using a list iterator
4. Skips the source of the event when notifying listeners
5. Invokes the method on each listener with the event as parameter
6. Handles exceptions during method invocation and logs errors
7. Does not remove failed listeners from the list during iteration
4683	Opens a NetCDF file specified in the command, processes the remaining command arguments, and prints the file contents using the provided writer. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. Handles file not found errors and ensures the writer is closed in the finally block.
4684	Method: `print(NetcdfFile nc, String command, Writer out, ucar.nc2.util.CancelTask ct)`

Summary: This method processes command-line arguments to configure how NetCDF file information is printed to an output writer. It supports various flags for controlling output format (like showing all values, coordinates only, NCML, or CDL format), specifying variable names to display, and temporarily changing the dataset location for printing. The method parses the command string, sets appropriate flags, calls a secondary print method with the parsed options, and restores the original dataset location if it was temporarily changed. Returns `true` if help was requested and displayed, otherwise returns the result of the actual printing operation.
4685	Reads variable data and returns it as a formatted string representation.
4686	Returns a string representation of variable data section by reading the specified section and formatting it using printArray method.

This method generates NcML (NetCDF Markup Language) output from a NetcdfFile, allowing control over which variables are included based on the WantValues parameter. It supports three levels of variable inclusion: none (no variables), coordsOnly (coordinate variables only), and all (all variables). The method validates inputs and uses an NcMLWriter to create and write the XML representation to the provided Writer.

Parameters:
- ncfile: The NetcdfFile to convert to NcML
- writer: The Writer to output the NcML to
- showValues: Determines which variables to include in the output
- url: The URL to use in the NcML output

4691	Reads a double value from an attribute in the given container, returning a default value if the attribute is not found or cannot be parsed.
4692	Adds a parameter to a coordinate transform by creating a new Parameter with the given name and variable name, then adding it to the transform. Returns true if successful, false if the specified variable does not exist in the dataset.
4693	The main method demonstrates parsing an access log line using a regular expression pattern matcher and an AccessLogParser. It first matches the log line against a regex pattern, prints whether the match was successful and the matcher object, then iterates through all captured groups printing their indices and values.

Parameters:
- original: The input string to perform substitutions on
- match: Array of strings to search for and replace
- subst: Array of replacement strings

Returns:
- A new string with all specified substitutions applied

Note: The current implementation has a logical flaw - it only performs substitutions if at least one match string is found, but then substitutes all match strings regardless of whether they're actually present in the original string. The method also assumes match and subst arrays have the same length.
5384	Removes all characters from the StringBuilder that are present in the output string, modifying the StringBuilder in-place by deleting matching characters.
5385	Method unreplace replaces all occurrences of string 'out' with character 'in' in the StringBuilder 'sb' by finding each occurrence, replacing the first character with 'in', and deleting the remaining characters of 'out'.
5386	Replaces characters in a StringBuilder based on a mapping from an 'out' string to an 'in' string. For each character in the StringBuilder, if it matches any character in the 'out' string, it is replaced with the corresponding character from the 'in' string at the same position. The replacement is done in-place on the StringBuilder object.
5387	Static method that replaces all occurrences of a matching string with a substitution string within a StringBuilder object, avoiding infinite loops by adjusting the search index after each replacement.

The method returns true if the partition is classified as a leaf node (more files than directories), false otherwise.
5596	Constructs and returns a list of child DirectoryBuilder objects for this directory partition. If children have already been constructed, returns the cached children. Uses index data when available and nocheck is specified, otherwise scans for children. Sets partition status based on whether children were found and marks children as constructed.

**eject(Object hashKey)** - Removes a cached file entry and closes the associated file resources.

This method safely removes a cached file entry identified by the hash key. It synchronizes access to the cache element to prevent concurrent modification issues, removes all associated file references from the files collection, closes each cached file (releasing system resources), and clears the cache entry. The method returns early if caching is disabled or if no matching cache entry exists. Debug output is printed when enabled to show the eject operation.
5603	Releases a cached file by unlocking it and updating access statistics. Returns true if successful, false if the file is not found in cache or if caching is disabled. If caching is disabled, the file is closed and null is set as cache. If the file is found but not locked, a warning is logged. Access counters and timestamps are updated upon successful release.
5604	Returns UNDEFINED if all input bytes are 0xff, otherwise computes a signed 32-bit integer from four bytes using the first byte's sign bit and combining all four bytes into a single integer value.
5605	Updates a cache element's access time and moves it to the front of the shadow cache, returning the updated element.
5606	Clears the cache, optionally force-deleting all files or selectively removing unlocked files. When force is true, clears entire cache and deletes all files. When false, only removes unlocked files from cache and files map, then closes the deleted files. Also removes empty cache elements and logs debug information about the operation.

Attempts to create the vertical transform from the GridDataset and time dimension. Logs an error message if transform creation fails, otherwise logs the successful transform type.
5608	Returns true if the longitude coordinate axis represents a global longitude coverage (spanning at least 360 degrees), false otherwise. The method first checks if the coordinate system is lat/lon and if the x-axis is a 1D coordinate axis. It then examines the edge values of the longitude axis to determine if the range covers 360 degrees or more.
5609	Returns true if the vertical coordinate system is positive upward, false otherwise. Checks if vertZaxis is null, then evaluates the positive direction attribute, and falls back to default rules based on axis type (Height is positive up, Pressure is positive down).
5610	Method finds the X and Y index coordinates from given geographic coordinates by querying the appropriate coordinate axis objects. It handles both 1D and 2D coordinate systems, returning the result in the provided array or creating a new one if null. For 1D systems, it directly queries the coordinate axes. For 2D systems, it uses a GridCoordinate2D object to find the element, returning -1 for both indices if no element is found. Throws IllegalStateException if neither 1D nor 2D axis types are matched.
5611	Method finds the X,Y index coordinates from given X,Y coordinates in a bounded grid system. Returns an array containing the X index at position 0 and Y index at position 1. Uses either 1D or 2D coordinate axes depending on the axis types. For 1D axes, it directly finds coordinate elements. For 2D axes, it uses a GridCoordinate2D object to find the coordinate elements. Throws IllegalStateException if the grid coordinate system is invalid.
5612	Converts latitude/longitude coordinates to x/y indices using the projection system. Takes latitude and longitude values, transforms them through the data projection to get projection coordinates, then converts those coordinates to pixel indices. Returns the resulting x/y index array.
5613	Converts latitude/longitude coordinates to projected XY coordinates and finds the corresponding array indices within bounds.
5614	Returns the pixel position for the indicator based on the selected item index, or -arrow_size if no items exist. For single item, returns center position. For multiple items, distributes selection indicator evenly across available width.
5615	Returns the item index corresponding to a pixel position in a scrollable component, with proper bounds checking and handling of edge cases where there are fewer than 2 items.
5616	Iterates over a file collection in the specified directory, applying a visitor pattern to process each file. Uses a custom stream filter to enumerate files, reads file attributes for each entry, and skips directories. If a file's attributes cannot be read, the error is logged and processing continues. The method tracks and prints the count of processed files when debug mode is enabled.
5617	Method: `getRemoteFiles`

Summary: This method downloads and processes remote log files from a specified URL. It constructs a download URL using the server prefix and log type, retrieves the content via HTTP GET request, and displays the contents in a text area. The method then processes each line of the response content in a background thread using SwingWorker to create RemoteLog objects for each entry. The operation can be cancelled during execution, and appropriate status messages are logged to the text area. Error handling is included for network issues and processing errors, with stack traces printed when exceptions occur.
5618	Returns the name of a subcenter based on its code, with specific names for subcenters 1 and 2, null for subcenter 0, and delegates to parent class for other cases.

5622	Subtracts two CalendarDate objects and returns the difference in terms of this period's duration, logging a warning for roundoff errors.
5623	Returns the conversion factor from another CalendarPeriod to this period by dividing their millisecond values. Warning is logged if the current period is Month or Year.
5624	Returns the value converted to milliseconds based on the calendar field type, with special handling for Month and Year fields using average values (30 days for month, 365 days for year) otherwise uses the default millisecs() method.
5625	Returns the duration offset between two calendar dates in the specified time unit, with a 5-second tolerance for equality comparison.
5626	Method `sync()` checks if the initialized file size is smaller than the actual file length and if index extension is enabled. If both conditions are true, it reinitializes the reader, gets the updated grid index, empties the netCDF file object, and reopens it with the new index, returning true. Otherwise, it returns false.
5627	Initializes Gempak grid parameter tables by adding parameter files, catches and handles exceptions during the process.
5628	The `put` method adds a `DataRootExt` object to both a map and a TreeSet. It uses the object's path as the key in the map and as the element in the TreeSet, then returns the result of the TreeSet's add operation (true if the path was added, false if it already existed).
5629	Finds the longest path in a sorted set that matches the beginning of the requested path. Returns the longest matching path or null if no match is found.
5630	Finds the DataRoot object that corresponds to the longest matching path for the given request path. Returns null if no matching path is found or if the path exists in the lookup but not in the internal map.
5631	Converts a DataRootExt object to a DataRoot object by either returning the existing DataRoot or reading it from catalog if not present.
5632	Returns the calendar date range for the specified calendar, or null if no date range is configured. If the calendar equals the default calendar, returns the cached date range. Otherwise, recreates and returns a new date range for the specified calendar.
5633	Returns a list of indices by mapping coordinates through a swap relationship and looking up indexes in indexMap. For each coordinate in the input list, it first checks if there's a swapped coordinate in the swap map. If so, it uses the swapped coordinate; otherwise, it uses the original coordinate. It then looks up the index of this coordinate in indexMap and adds it to the result list. If any coordinate cannot be found in indexMap, it throws an IllegalStateException.
5634	Creates a new NetcdfFileWriter instance for writing netCDF files with the specified version, location, and chunking configuration.
5635	Adds a new group to the specified parent group within the netCDF file, throwing an exception if not in define mode or if the parent is null. Returns the newly created group.

5672	This method names datasets in a hierarchical list using a series of DatasetNamers. It creates a temporary dataset to hold named datasets, iterates through each DatasetNamer, and applies naming logic to unnamed datasets. If a DatasetNamer adds a new level, it creates a new dataset for that level. Named datasets are either added to the level dataset or the temporary named dataset, then removed from the original unnamed list. Finally, all named datasets are added back to the original container dataset and the temporary dataset is removed.

5807	Validates if a string contains only alphanumeric characters and matches at least one string in a constrained set. Returns false if the input string is null, the constrained set is null or empty, or if the string contains invalid characters. If the string is valid alphanumeric, it checks against the constrained set (case-insensitive if specified) and returns true if any match is found.
5808	This method checks if a given file path is valid and can be descended into without going above the root directory. It splits the path by "/" and processes each segment:

6158	Returns the URL of a resource file using the provided ClassLoader, and optionally updates the resource search status.
6159	Method: `autoConfig()`
Description: Automatically configures the logging context by attempting to load configuration from system properties, then from assets, in that order. Returns early once a valid configuration is found and applied.

Parameters: None

Throws: `JoranException` - if there is an error during the configuration process

Returns: None

Summary: This method performs automatic logging configuration by first checking system properties for a config file URL, and if not found, then searches for a configuration file within the application's assets. It applies the first successfully found configuration and stops processing. The method handles status listener setup and Android-specific property configuration before attempting the main configuration steps.
6160	Logs an info status message about whether a resource was found or not found during resource search, using the StatusManager from the logger context.
6161	Converts a SocketAddress object to its string representation, extracting just the address portion by removing the leading "/" delimiter if present.
6162	Creates and returns a new ThreadPoolExecutor with core and maximum pool sizes defined by CoreConstants, zero keep-alive time, and a SynchronousQueue. Uses a custom THREAD_FACTORY for thread creation.
6163	Starts all converters in a converter chain, recursively processing composite converters and calling start() on dynamic converters.
6164	The `subAppend` method first checks if a rollover is needed by synchronizing on the triggering policy and calling `isTriggeringEvent`. If a rollover is detected, it performs the rollover operation before appending the event. Finally, it delegates to the parent class's `subAppend` method to complete the append process.
6165	Adds a key-value pair to the properties map after trimming whitespace from the value. Null keys or values are ignored.
6166	Returns the value of the specified property key from the local properties map, or falls back to the context's property if not found locally.
6167	Returns a Converter by compiling the given Node with the provided converter map and context.
6168	Method E() parses an expression by first parsing a term T(), then optionally parsing additional terms Eopt(). If parsing fails at any point, it returns null. Otherwise, it links the parsed terms together and returns the first term.
6169	Method T() parses and returns a Node object based on the current token. It handles two main cases: LITERAL tokens, which create a simple literal node, and PERCENT tokens, which create a formatting node with optional format modifiers. The method advances the token pointer appropriately and throws ScanException if tokens are null or unexpected. Returns null for unexpected token types.
6170	The method `escape` takes an escaped character string, a StringBuffer, a character, and a pointer position as parameters. It then calls the superclass's `escape` method with a formatted string consisting of a percent sign followed by a right parenthesis, along with the provided StringBuffer, character, and pointer values. This effectively escapes the specified characters in the buffer at the given position.
6171	Converts a fixed date to a regex pattern by processing token converters, appending literal values, escaped digits for integer tokens, and date-specific regex patterns while preserving the original date formatting structure.

If the context has no status manager, prints a warning message. Otherwise, checks if the highest status level is an error and if so, prints all status messages from the status manager.
6193	Prints status information using the provided context and threshold value, throwing an exception if context is null and handling cases where the context has no status manager.
6194	Handles the first line of a throwable by building and writing its stack trace information to the output stream, including proper prefix formatting and "Caused by" designation for non-root exceptions.
6195	Returns the Entry associated with the given key from either the liveMap or lingerersMap, checking liveMap first.
6196	Method removes an entry from liveMap by key and moves it to lingerersMap, effectively marking the entry as ending its life cycle. If no entry exists for the given key in liveMap, the method returns immediately without performing any action.
6197	Parses a formatting string in the format "min.max" or "min" into a FormatInfo object, where min and max are integers representing minimum and maximum width constraints. Throws IllegalArgumentException for invalid input or null argument. Handles negative values by adjusting padding/truncation flags accordingly.
6198	Renames a source file to a target file, with special handling for cross-volume renames and error conditions. Returns early if source and target are the same file. Creates missing target directories if needed. If direct rename fails due to different file systems, attempts to rename by copying. Throws RolloverFailure if source file doesn't exist. Logs warnings for various scenarios including failed renames and cross-volume operations.
6199	Method `areOnDifferentVolumes` determines whether a source file and target file are located on different file volumes by comparing their file stores. Returns `true` if they're on different volumes, `false` if on the same volume, or `null` if an error occurs or parent directory doesn't exist. Throws `RolloverFailure` if JDK version is below 7.
6200	Returns the value of the specified environment variable, or null if the variable is not defined or access is denied due to security restrictions.

6206	Adds a new status message, fires an event, updates the maximum level, and manages the status list with a buffer.
6207	Adds a StatusListener to the listener list, returning true if successful and false if the listener is already present (specifically for OnConsoleStatusListener instances).
6208	Finds and returns the first applicable implicit action for the given element path and attributes, or null if none is found.
6209	Returns a list of applicable Actions for the given element path and attributes by first matching actions from the rule store, then falling back to looking up implicit actions if no match is found.
6210	Sets the ClassLoader to use for loading Android SystemProperties class and its methods. If null is passed, uses the current class's ClassLoader. Initializes the SystemProperties class reference and retrieves the get() and getBoolean() methods for later use.
6211	Returns a string value for the given key from system properties, falling back to a default value if the key is not found or has null/empty value. Throws IllegalArgumentException if encountered during invocation.
6212	Returns the boolean value for the given key from system properties, or the default value if not found. Throws IllegalArgumentException if invocation fails due to illegal arguments.
6213	Returns a string with the first character converted to lowercase. If the input string is null or empty, returns the input as-is. For non-empty strings, converts only the first character to lowercase while preserving the rest of the string unchanged.
6214	Returns an array of MethodDescriptor objects for all public methods in the given class.
6215	Returns an array of PropertyDescriptor objects for all bean properties found in the given class, based on matching getter and setter methods. The method analyzes all methods in the class, identifies property names by stripping "get" or "set" prefixes, and creates PropertyDescriptor objects that link corresponding getter and setter methods together.

Parameters: ic (InterpretationContext), name (String), attributes (Attributes)
Returns: void
Throws: ActionException

Summary: Begins the shutdown hook configuration process by instantiating a ShutdownHookBase object from the specified class name or defaulting to DefaultShutdownHook if none provided. The method retrieves the class name from attributes, validates it, creates an instance using OptionHelper.instantiateByClassName, sets the context, and pushes the hook onto the interpretation context stack. If instantiation fails, it logs an error and throws an ActionException.
6222	Ends the interpretation process by registering a shutdown hook with the JVM runtime. Pops the hook object from the stack, creates a new Thread with the hook, registers it with the JVM's shutdown hooks, and stores a reference to the hook thread in the context. If the object at the top of the stack is not the expected hook, a warning is added.
6223	Returns an array of enabled SSL/TLS protocols by either using default protocols or filtering supported protocols based on included/excluded protocol configurations.

6228	Adds a new appender to the appender list, throwing an IllegalArgumentException if the appender is null.
6229	Removes the specified appender from the list of appenders. Returns true if the appender was successfully removed, false otherwise.
6230	Removes an appender with the specified name from the appender list. Returns true if an appender was removed, false otherwise. If the name is null, returns false without making any changes.
6231	Handles parent level changes by updating the effective level when level is null, then propagating the change to all children recursively.
6232	Calls appenders in the logger hierarchy, starting from this logger up to the root, breaking if a non-additive logger is encountered. Reports warning if no appenders are defined in the hierarchy.
6233	Detaches an appender from the logging infrastructure. Returns true if successful, false if the appender could not be detached or if the internal appender attach instance is null.
6234	Creates a child logger with the specified last name part, validating that it doesn't contain dots. If the current logger is root, the child uses the lastPart as its name; otherwise, it concatenates the current logger's name with the lastPart using a dot separator. The child logger inherits the effective level from the parent and is added to the children list.
6235	Calls the turbo filter chain decision method on the logger context with the current logger, marker, and level parameters, returning the filter reply result.
6236	Logs a SLF4J event by converting its level to a Logback level and filtering/appending it through the logging framework.
6237	Method Summary:
Attempts to create a socket connection, retrying with exponential backoff delays if initial creation fails. Returns the successfully created socket or null if interrupted during the process.

Key behaviors:
- Calls useDefaultsForMissingFields() to set default values

6250	This method evaluates whether a logging event contains any of the specified markers. It takes an ILoggingEvent as input and returns true if the event's marker contains any marker string from the markerList, false otherwise. If the event has no marker, it returns false immediately. The evaluation is performed by checking if the event's marker contains any of the predefined marker strings in the list.
6251	Returns a formatted string representing the client thread name for a socket connection, including the remote socket address in the format "Logback SocketNode (client: address)".
6252	Checks if two files reside on the same file store by comparing their file store objects through reflection-based invocation of Path and Files API methods. Throws IllegalArgumentException if either file doesn't exist, or RolloverFailure if the comparison fails.
6253	Starts the appender by initializing the cyclic buffer tracker, building a mail session from properties, creating a subject layout, and marking the appender as started if session creation succeeds. If session creation fails, an error is added and the method returns without starting.
6254	Appends an event object to a cyclic buffer, processes it through discriminator, evaluates against event evaluator, and sends asynchronously or synchronously. Handles error counting, buffer cleanup, and tracker status reporting.
6255	Sends an email notification using the content from a cyclic buffer and SMTP transport, including handling of subject line formatting, email addresses, and content type determination.
6256	Adds an MDC value-level pair to the map, but only if the value is not already present. If the value already exists, an error is logged.
6257	Creates a DynamicConverter instance for the given keyword by looking up the converter class name in the converterMap and instantiating it using OptionHelper. Returns null if the converter class cannot be instantiated or if no converter is registered for the keyword.
6258	Creates a composite converter instance based on a composite node's keyword by looking up the converter class in the map and instantiating it, returning null if instantiation fails or no converter is registered for the keyword.
6259	Determines the compression mode based on the file name pattern suffix. Sets the compressionMode field to GZ if the pattern ends with ".gz", to ZIP if it ends with ".zip", or to NONE otherwise, and logs the corresponding message.
6260	Configures the context using the given URL by opening a connection, disabling cache, reading the input stream, and then closing the stream quietly in the finally block.
6261	public final void doConfigure(File file) throws JoranException {
    FileInputStream fis = null;
    try {
      URL url = file.toURI().toURL();
      informContextOfURLUsedForConfiguration(getContext(), url);
      fis = new FileInputStream(file);

      // this closes the stream for us
      doConfigure(fis, url.toExternalForm());
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      String errMsg = "Could not open [" + file.getPath() + "].";
      addError(errMsg, ioe);
      throw new JoranException(errMsg, ioe);
    } finally {
      CloseUtil.closeQuietly(fis);
    }
  }

Summary:
This method configures the logging system using a File. It converts the file to a URL, informs the context of the configuration URL, opens a FileInputStream, and delegates to doConfigure with the stream and URL string. It handles IOExceptions by adding error messages and rethrowing as JoranException, and ensures the FileInputStream is closed quietly in the finally block.
6262	public final void doConfigure(InputStream inputStream) throws JoranException {
    try {
      doConfigure(new InputSource(inputStream));
    } finally {
      try {
        inputStream.close();

        throw new JoranException(errMsg, ioe);
      }
    }
  }

Summary:
Configures the object using an InputStream, ensuring the stream is properly closed afterward. If the stream cannot be closed, a JoranException is thrown with an error message and the underlying IOException.
6263	Builds the interpreter by creating a rule store, adding instance and implicit rules, initializing the interpreter with context and rules, and setting up the interpretation context with default nested component registry rules.
6264	Configures the logging system using the provided InputSource, records SAX events, processes them, and registers a safe fallback configuration if no XML parsing errors occurred.
6265	Configures the context by playing back a list of SAX events through a synchronized interpreter, preventing concurrent configurations of the same context.
6266	Returns the value of a property with the specified key. If the key matches CONTEXT_NAME_KEY, returns the name of the context. Otherwise, returns the value from the property map associated with the given key.
6267	Sets the name of the context, but only if the context doesn't already have a meaningful name. If the context already has a name that isn't the default context name, throws an IllegalStateException. The operation is idempotent - calling with the same name has no effect.
6268	Returns true if the given context has at least one status listener registered with its status manager, false otherwise.
6269	Returns the timestamp of the most recent reset message from the status list, or -1 if no reset message is found.
6270	Starts the component by parsing a pattern, compiling it into a node structure, and initializing converters. If parsing fails, adds an error message and increments the error count. Sets the component's started status to true only if no errors occurred.
6271	Returns a map containing effective converter mappings by combining default converters with context-specific converters, where context converters override default ones.
6272	Returns the HTML file header including DOCTYPE declaration, html structure, title, CSS styles, and opening body tag.
6273	Returns the footer content for an HTML file, appending a line separator followed by closing HTML tags (`</body></html>`).
6274	Method: begin
Purpose: Initializes and configures a Logback appender based on XML configuration attributes.

Parameters:
- ec: InterpretationContext containing the parsing context
- localName: The name of the XML element being processed
- attributes: XML attributes containing appender configuration

Process:
1. Resets internal state variables (appender reference and error flag)
2. Extracts the class name from the "class" attribute
3. Validates that a class name is provided
4. Instantiates the appender using the specified class name
5. Sets the context on the appender
6. Processes the appender name from the "name" attribute
7. Adds the appender to the execution context's appender bag
8. Pushes the appender onto the context's object stack

Returns: None (void method)

Exception Handling: Throws ActionException if appender creation fails
Error Conditions: Missing class name, instantiation failures
Side Effects: Modifies the interpretation context's object map and pushes the new appender onto the context's stack
6275	Ends the appender configuration by starting the appender if it implements LifeCycle and verifying the appender is at the top of the interpretation stack.
6276	Returns a copy of the clients collection in a thread-safe manner by acquiring and releasing the clientsLock.
6277	Adds a client to the clients collection in a thread-safe manner using a lock.
6278	Removes a client from the clients collection in a thread-safe manner using a lock.
6279	Returns a copy of the context map stored in thread-local storage, or null if no context map exists.
6280	Returns the getValueOf method for the specified type, or null if not found or access is denied.
6281	Returns a FilterReply by sequentially executing turbo filters in the chain until a definitive decision (DENY or ACCEPT) is reached, or returns NEUTRAL if no filter makes a definitive decision.
6282	Returns true if the current operating system is Android by checking for Android-specific system properties and environment variables including "os.name" containing "Linux" and environment variables "ANDROID_ROOT" and "ANDROID_DATA" with expected paths.
6283	Initializes the logging context by auto-configuring the default logger context, handling configuration exceptions, and setting up the context selector binder. If auto-configuration fails, it reports the error and prints status information if no status listener is present. The method catches any instantiation exceptions and reports them appropriately, ultimately setting the initialized flag to true upon successful initialization.
6284	Returns an array of files in the specified directory that match the given stem regex pattern. Returns an empty array if the file is null, doesn't exist, or is not a directory. Uses FilenameFilter to filter files based on regex matching of their names.
6285	Method Summary: retrospectivePrint()

This method prints status messages that have elapsed longer than a specified threshold time. It retrieves the current time and the status manager from the context, then iterates through all status messages. For each status message, it checks if the elapsed time since the message was created exceeds the threshold, and if so, prints the status message. The method returns early if the context is null.
6286	Converts a syslog facility string to its corresponding integer constant value. Throws IllegalArgumentException if the input string is not a valid syslog facility.
6287	Returns a File object for the database file, using the provided filename if valid, otherwise falling back to a default database path.
6288	Clears expired logs from the database if the cleanup threshold has been reached, updating the last cleanup time and performing log cleanup based on maximum history setting.
6289	Checks if a cleanup operation has expired based on a timeout duration and last cleanup time. Returns true if no expiry is set, or if the time since last cleanup exceeds the expiry threshold.
6290	Summary: Inserts a logging event into SQLite database using the provided statement, binding event data and handling potential insertion failures.
6291	Method: secondarySubAppend
Description: Appends secondary logging data by merging properties, inserting properties into database, and optionally inserting throwable information if present.

Parameters:
- event: ILoggingEvent object containing logging information
- eventId: Long value representing the event identifier

Behavior: 
1. Merges property maps from the logging event
2. Inserts the merged properties into the database using the event ID
3. If the event contains throwable information, inserts the throwable data using the event ID

Exceptions: Throws SQLException if database operations fail
6292	Binds logging event data to SQLite statement parameters including timestamp, formatted message, logger name, level string, thread name, and reference flags.
6293	Converts an object to a string, truncates it to 254 characters if necessary, and returns empty string if the object is null.
6294	Computes a reference mask for an ILoggingEvent based on whether properties exist in MDC and logger context, and whether an exception is present. Returns a short value with bits set according to PROPERTIES_EXIST and EXCEPTION_EXISTS constants.
6295	Merge logger context properties and MDC properties into a single map, with MDC properties taking priority over context properties.
6296	Inserts an exception record into the database with the specified event ID, index, and text message.
6297	Returns the length of the matching prefix between this ElementPath and the given ElementPath p. Compares the part lists element by element using equalityCheck() and returns the count of matching consecutive elements from the beginning. Returns 0 if either path is null or empty, or if no matching prefix exists.
6298	Returns the effective log level by comparing the current level with all nested status levels and returning the maximum value.
6299	Sets a property on an object by name and value, with null checking and error handling. If the property doesn't exist or setting fails, appropriate warning messages are logged. The property name is automatically decapitalized before processing.
6300	Returns true if the given class can be instantialized with a no-argument constructor, false otherwise.
6301	Returns a new HashMap containing a copy of the parentValue HashMap. If parentValue is null, returns null.
6302	Processes an included configuration file by opening it, recording SAX events, trimming head/tail tags, and dynamically adding events to the interpretation context.
6303	Opens a URL and returns an InputStream, with optional warning logging if the operation fails.
6304	Removes the opening and closing tags (INCLUDED_TAG or CONFIG_TAG) from the beginning and end of the SAX event list in the recorder, if they exist. The method first checks if the first event matches either tag, and if so, removes it. Then it checks if the last event matches the corresponding closing tag and removes it if present.
6305	Method Summary: Attempts to start a server by creating a server socket, setting up a listener, and initializing a server runner. Returns true if successful, false if an exception occurs during startup.

Detailed Summary:
The `shouldStart()` method attempts to initialize a server by:
1. Creating a server socket using the configured port, backlog, and InetAddress
2. Creating a server listener for RemoteAppenderClient connections
3. Setting up a server runner with the listener and scheduled executor service
4. Returning true on successful initialization or false with error logging on failure

The method handles exceptions by logging the error and closing the server socket quietly before returning false.
6306	Returns true if the exception is transient, meaning it can be safely retried. A transient exception is determined by: 1) if there's no cause, checking if the status code indicates a server error, 2) if the cause is an AlgoliaException, delegating to its isTransient() method, 3) if the cause is an IOException, returning true, or 4) otherwise returning false.
6307	Sets default hosts for Algolia client by creating a list that starts with the DSN host followed by shuffled fallback hosts, then assigns these hosts for both read and write operations.
6308	Ensures that a local index is created and initialized if it doesn't already exist, using the client's root data directory, application ID, and raw index name.
6309	Method `sync()` initiates a synchronization process by first validating that data selection queries exist, then using a synchronized block to prevent concurrent sync operations. It submits a background task to execute the actual synchronization logic (`_sync()`) using a local build executor service, ensuring thread safety and preventing multiple simultaneous sync operations.
6310	Method checks if synchronization is needed based on time delay or query modifications, and triggers sync if required.
6311	Waits for a task to be processed by the Algolia API, polling the task status at increasing intervals until it becomes "published" or maximum wait time is reached. Returns the final task status JSONObject when published.
6312	Lists offline sync indexes by scanning the application directory for directories with offline data and returning their names in a JSON response.
6313	Converts an InputStream to a String by reading it as UTF-8 characters using a character array buffer.
6314	Converts an InputStream to a byte array by reading all data from the stream into a buffer and writing it to an output stream, then returning the complete byte array representation. Throws an AlgoliaException if any IO error occurs during the reading process.
6315	Consumes and closes both input and error streams from a HttpURLConnection, then disconnects it, silently handling any IOExceptions that may occur during the process.
6316	Returns a list of hostnames that are up or can be retried. If no hosts are up, returns the original list of hosts.
6317	Sets the type filter for places query, converting Type enum values to their string representations. Returns the current instance to allow method chaining.
6318	Starts the asynchronous browsing operation if not already started, throwing an IllegalStateException if already started. Sets up the request using the index browseAsync method with the provided query, request options, and completion handler.
6319	Puts a key-value pair into the cache with expiration timeout, returning the previous value if the key already existed.
6320	Returns the value associated with the specified key from the cache if it exists and hasn't expired; otherwise returns null and removes expired entries.
6321	Waits for all threads in the threads collection to complete by calling join() on each thread. If any thread is interrupted during the join operation, or if an exception was caught during thread execution, it will be rethrown.
6322	Compares two version strings by parsing them into ordinal arrays and sequentially comparing corresponding ordinals. Returns positive integer if first version is greater, negative if second version is greater, zero if equal. Handles version strings of different lengths by treating missing ordinals as zero.
6323	Reports an exception with the given test ID, writing exception details to a file in the user directory. If the maximum exception count is exceeded, the exception is not reported. Returns early if the exception is null or if tmp file creation fails. The method logs the exception and its stack trace to a temporary file before renaming it to a permanent filename.
6324	Copies a directory recursively from source to target location, creating necessary subdirectories and copying all files while preserving directory structure.
6325	Initializes the simulator properties by loading from a specified file or default location. If no file is provided, it looks for a properties file in the working directory. Returns null if no file is found in the working directory, otherwise returns the simulator properties instance.
6326	Returns the value of a static field from the specified class using reflection, throwing a ReflectionException if the field is not found.
6327	Returns the Method object with the specified name from the given class, or null if not found.

6334	Writes a long integer value as JSON, optionally escaping it with quotes based on context settings.
6335	Writes a double number to JSON output, wrapping it in quotes if it's special (NaN or Infinity) or if escaping is enabled by the context.
6336	Reads a JSON string value from the input, handling escape sequences and Unicode characters, returning the parsed string as a ByteString.
6337	Reads and returns a contiguous sequence of JSON numeric characters from the reader.
6338	Reads a JSON integer value from the input stream, handling escaped numbers and converting the string representation to a long primitive.
6339	Reads a double value from JSON input, handling both quoted and unquoted numeric formats with proper validation and error handling for malformed numeric data.
6340	Reads a JSON string, decodes it from Base64, and returns the decoded ByteString.

6356	Adds a condition factor to the collection, throwing a WebDAVException if the factor already exists.
6357	Creates a ConditionTerm by parsing tokens from a StreamTokenizer, expecting opening parenthesis, condition factors, and closing parenthesis, throwing WebDAVException for parsing errors.
6358	This method checks if the current condition matches a given condition term by comparing their factors. It iterates through all condition factors, verifying that each factor in the current condition is present in the condition term (taking into account negations), and ensures the total number of factors matches. The method returns true if all factors match and the factor counts are equal, false otherwise.
6359	Returns a Reader for the DSL content based on the rule source and input resource, or null if not found or not accessible.
6360	Loads and reads DSL configuration from a given file, setting validity flag to true upon successful reading, throwing IllegalStateException if unable to open the file.

6364	Adds a href attribute to the root element after encoding and duplicate checking.
6365	Inserts a new href element before a reference href element in the document. If the new href already exists or the reference href is not found, the operation will either return early or throw an assertion error.
6366	Removes the first occurrence of a href element with the specified href value from the root element. The method encodes the input href value and searches for a matching href element among the root's children. If found, it removes the element and returns immediately. If no matching element is found, the root remains unchanged.
6367	Adds a new propstat element to the root element and returns a PropStat object initialized with the new element. The method ensures that if an href element exists, no additional href or status siblings are present before adding the propstat element. Throws an assertion error if the element construction fails internally.

1. Iterates through each proposal in the collection
2. Gets the display string of each proposal and splits it by spaces
3. If the display string is empty or contains no spaces, skips to the next proposal
4. Splits the new proposal by spaces
5. If the new proposal is empty or contains no spaces, skips to the next proposal
6. Compares the first word of both proposals
7. Returns `true` immediately when a match is found, otherwise returns `false` after checking all proposals

6420	Returns the last non-blank, non-dash line from the input text, with optional bracket handling. Trims each line and ignores lines that are blank or start with "-". If the last line contains "(" but doesn't end with ")", it removes everything after the first "(". If the last line contains "(" and ends with ")", it returns an empty string. Returns empty string if no valid lines are found or if bracket handling results in empty string.
6421	Binds a single binding string to the given ID by converting it to a String array and calling the overloaded bind method.
6422	Binds a document ID with two string bindings into a single string result.
6423	Binds a message ID to its formatted string representation using resource bundle lookup and optional parameter bindings.

6624	Method `needNewBuffer` manages a collection of byte buffers for efficient memory usage. When called with a required buffer size (`newcount`), it either recycles an existing buffer if available or creates a new one. 

If there are unused buffers in the collection, it moves to the next buffer, updates the filled buffer sum, and reuses the buffer. Otherwise, it creates a new buffer with a size that's either the requested size (if creating the first buffer) or double the previous buffer size (if growing), ensuring the new buffer can accommodate the requested data. The new buffer is added to the collection and becomes the current buffer.

Key operations:
- Recycles existing buffers when possible
- Creates new buffers with exponential growth strategy
- Maintains running sum of filled buffer sizes
- Updates buffer index to track current buffer
- Ensures buffer capacity meets minimum requirements

Parameters:
- `newcount`: Minimum required buffer size in bytes

Side effects:
- Modifies `currentBuffer` reference
- Modifies `currentBufferIndex` 
- Modifies `filledBufferSum`
- Adds new buffer to `buffers` collection

It returns `true` when the namespace is considered foreign (not empty and not matching the schema URI), and `false` otherwise.
6666	Trim quotes from the beginning and end of a string if they match and are either single or double quotes.
6667	Splits a string into an array of strings, respecting quoted substrings and whitespace delimiters. Handles both single and double quotes for preserving whitespace within quoted sections. Returns an empty array for empty or whitespace-only input.
6668	Method `rectify(Element e)` performs HTML/XML element structure correction by:

1. **Finding appropriate parent**: Travels up the stack to find a parent element that can contain the given element `e`
2. **Creating missing parents**: If no suitable parent exists, creates parent elements recursively until a valid parent is found
3. **Stack cleanup**: Pops elements from the stack until reaching the appropriate parent level

6986	Downloads a remote file from the given URL and saves it to the deployment root directory, returning the local file path.
6987	Updates the deployed components list by collecting all component IDs from various component repositories and resource adaptor entity links, then replaces the current deployedComponents collection with the new one. The method handles exceptions by logging warnings if the update fails.
6988	Installs a Deployable Unit (DU) by first checking if it's ready for installation. If ready, it executes installation actions, marks the DU as installed, adds it to the deployed list, and updates components. If not ready, it adds the DU to a waiting list for future installation attempts. The method also processes any waiting DUs that may now be installable after the current installation.
6989	Method to uninstall a deployable unit by updating deployed components, checking installation status, removing components if already absent, executing uninstall actions if ready, or adding to waiting list if dependencies prevent uninstallation. Throws Exception if uninstall cannot proceed due to dependencies.
6990	Method: processInternalUndeploy

Summary: Processes the undeployment of a DeployableUnit by marking it as uninstalled, removing it from the uninstallation waiting list, updating deployed components, and then checking if any other waiting DUs are ready for uninstallation. For ready DUs, it schedules removal through the SLEE sub-deployer and removes them from the waiting list, then restarts the iteration to check for any newly ready DUs.
6991	Shows the current deployment status including deployable units waiting for install and uninstall, along with their dependencies and missing components.
6992	This method determines whether a log record should be processed by checking if it contains an exception. If the record has an exception (thrown), it calls `logWithThrowable` to handle it; otherwise, it uses `logWithoutThrowable`. The method always returns `false`, indicating that the log record is handled but not subsequently processed by the logging framework.
6993	Returns the logger instance for the given log record, creating and caching it if necessary.
6994	Returns a set of components that refer to the given component by checking dependencies across all component types (EventTypeComponent, LibraryComponent, ProfileSpecificationComponent, ResourceAdaptorComponent, ResourceAdaptorTypeComponent, SbbComponent, ServiceComponent).

7000	Updates the configuration properties of the resource adaptor entity, throwing exceptions if active reconfiguration is not supported or if the entity is in an invalid state.
7001	Method `sleeRunning()` activates a resource adaptor object if the entity is active and sets up fault tolerant context if needed. It calls `raActive()` on the resource adaptor object and handles any exceptions that occur during these operations. The method throws `InvalidStateException` and includes error logging for exception cases.
7002	Method `sleeStopping()` performs cleanup operations when stopping a Service Level Element (SLEE). It checks if the current state is active, and if so, calls the resource adapter's stopping method and schedules all activities for ending. The method handles potential exceptions from the resource adapter and logs any errors that occur during the stopping process. It requires the transaction to be active and throws exceptions for invalid states or missing transactions.
7003	Activates a resource adaptor entity by transitioning it from inactive to active state and invoking the resource adaptor's activation method if the SLEE container is running. If the resource adaptor is fault-tolerant, it also sets up fault-tolerant context before activation. Throws InvalidStateException if the entity is not in inactive state.
7004	Deactivates the resource adaptor entity by transitioning it to STOPPING state and scheduling cleanup operations to execute after 500ms delay. Throws InvalidStateException if entity is not active or TransactionRequiredLocalException if transaction is required. The deactivation process involves calling raStopping() on the associated object if it's active, then scheduling a timer task to complete the deactivation logic including calling scheduleAllActivitiesEnd() or allActivitiesEnded() based on the object's state.
7005	Schedules the end of all activities for this RA entity if it's the single member of a cluster, otherwise marks activities as ended immediately.
7006	Removes the entity by unconfiguring the object, shutting down fault-tolerant resources if applicable, unregistering from trace management, and setting the state to null. Throws InvalidStateException if the entity is not in an inactive state.
7007	Returns the resource adaptor interface for the specified resource adaptor type ID by looking up the component descriptor and extracting its resource adaptor interface.
7008	Method `serviceActive` checks if a receivable service has active events and notifies the object if so, while catching and logging any unchecked exceptions that occur during the process.
7009	Returns the dereferenced ActivityHandle by resolving references through the handle reference factory when the input handle is an ActivityHandleReference, otherwise returns the handle as-is.
7010	Method `activityEnded` handles the completion of an activity by:
1. Logging the activity end event
2. Resolving the actual activity handle if the input is a reference
3. Notifying the object when the activity ends (if callback is enabled)
4. Checking if the resource adaptor is stopping and cleaning up timer task if no activities remain
5. Invoking `allActivitiesEnded()` callback when all activities have completed during shutdown

The method manages both direct activity handles and reference handles while handling proper cleanup during resource adaptor shutdown.
7011	Updates the RA configuration with the provided properties after validation.
7012	Verifies configuration properties by merging default properties with new properties, validating that all properties have non-null values, and delegating final validation to a resource adapter object. If validation passes, the configuration is updated with the new properties.
7013	Method raStopping() transitions the ResourceAdaptorObject to STOPPING state if it's currently ACTIVE, then calls the RA's raStopping() method. Throws InvalidStateException if the RA is not in ACTIVE state.
7014	Method raInactive() transitions a resource adaptor object from STOPPING to INACTIVE state and calls the underlying object's raInactive() method, but only if the current state is STOPPING. Otherwise, it throws an InvalidStateException with a descriptive error message indicating the current state. The method also supports trace logging when enabled.
7015	Method raUnconfigure() transitions the ResourceAdaptorObjectState from INACTIVE to UNCONFIGURED and calls the underlying object's raUnconfigure() method, throwing InvalidStateException if the object is not in the INACTIVE state.
7016	Removes the Resource Adaptor context from the object if it is in UNCONFIGURED state, otherwise throws InvalidStateException.
7017	Unsets the fault-tolerant resource adaptor context from the current object if it is fault tolerant, otherwise throws an IllegalArgumentException.
7018	Builds a map of profile attributes by analyzing getter methods from the profile component interface class, converting method names to attribute names, and setting appropriate flags based on whether the attribute is indexed or unique.
7019	Resumes a suspended event context by canceling the scheduled future, routing previously frozen events through the event router, removing barriers from the activity event queue, and continuing event routing. The resume operation is executed using the activity executor service to prevent thread concurrency issues.
7020	Returns the set of activity context handles by getting the children names from the node, or an empty set if the node is null.
7021	Removes the MBean from the MBean server and cleans up all usage parameter sets. Logs debug information about closing and removing operations, and handles exceptions during MBean unregistration and usage parameter removal with error logging.
7022	Returns the ObjectName of the usage MBean for the specified parameter set name, throwing exceptions for null parameters or unrecognized parameter set names.
7023	Method `decorateAbstractClass()` decorates an abstract class by modifying its JNDI environment calls and writing the modified class to the deployment directory if changes were made. It retrieves the abstract class from the class pool, throws a deployment exception if not found, decorates JNDI calls, and if modifications were made, writes the class file to disk and returns true, otherwise returns false. If writing fails, it throws a SLEE exception. The method uses defrost to ensure proper state management after file writing. Returns true if the abstract class was successfully decorated and written, false otherwise.
7024	Summary: This method fires an event with the specified parameters, delegating to another fireEvent method with a null callback parameter. It serves as a convenience method for triggering events without requiring a callback.

7036	Method that determines whether a deployable unit (DU) should be accepted based on its URL and name. It first checks if the DU name is in an explicit accept list. If not, it examines JAR files to see if they contain a deployable unit descriptor (META-INF/deployable-unit.xml). Returns true if the DU should be accepted, false otherwise.
7037	Initializes a deployable unit by processing its URL and name, handling both existing units and new JAR-based deployments with descriptor parsing.
7038	Method start initiates deployment of a deployable unit by creating a wrapper object from the provided URL and name, then attempts to install the deployable unit through the container's deployment manager if it exists, with thread synchronization to handle concurrent undeployment operations.
7039	Stops a deployable unit by uninstalling it from the SLEE container and removing it from the local deployment list. If uninstallation fails due to dependency issues, it retries later. If the deployable unit is in an invalid state, it logs a warning and waits. Any deployment exceptions are wrapped in an IllegalStateException, while other errors are logged. The method uses a file-based lookup to identify and process the deployable unit.
7040	Returns a formatted string showing the status of deployment units, components, acceptance list, running undeployments, and deployment manager status.

7058	Generates a concrete implementation class for the SbbLocalObject interface by creating class links, inheritance relationships, and implementing required methods, then writes the class to disk and loads it into the current classloader.
7059	Creates a getter method name by prefixing "is" for boolean fields or "get" for other fields, based on the field class type.
7060	Converts a string argument to the appropriate object type based on the field class, handling both primitive types and wrapper classes through reflection.
7061	Sets the profile ID by specifying a profile table name and profile name. Throws NullPointerException if either parameter is null, or IllegalArgumentException if the profile table name contains the '/' character. Clears the address when setting the profile ID.
7062	Extracts and cleans a message from a string, removing surrounding <pre> tags that may encapsulate the text (specifically for Firefox 2 compatibility).

7070	Returns a profile object for the specified profile name, creating and initializing it if necessary. Retrieves the object from transaction data cache if it exists, otherwise creates a new instance from the profile object pool, activates it with the profile name, and stores it in the transaction data cache for future use. Returns null if the profile name is unrecognized.
7071	Method Summary:
`passivateProfileObjectOnTxEnd` registers transactional actions to handle profile object cleanup at transaction boundaries. It adds an "after rollback" action that invalidates and returns the profile object to its pool, and a "before commit" action that fires events, passivates the profile if ready and not marked for removal, or removes it if marked for removal, then returns it to the pool.
7072	Sets the value of this property editor from a text representation, parsing component IDs in the format "name vendor version" separated by CID_SEPARATOR.

Throws DeploymentException if any issues occur during class generation, file writing, or class loading operations.
7074	This method generates concrete implementations of interface methods for an ActivityContextInterface. It iterates through interface methods, skipping those declared in ActivityContextInterface or ActivityContextInterfaceExt, then creates corresponding concrete methods with auto-generated bodies that either get or set field values based on the method name prefix ("get" or "set"). The generated methods are added to the concrete activity context interface class.

7087	Checks if all dependencies for the component are satisfied by verifying that either the component is self-sufficient or all external dependencies are already deployed. Returns true if dependencies are satisfied, false otherwise. If showMissing is true and dependencies are missing, logs the list of missing dependencies.
7088	Method `hasDuplicates()` checks if any components in the current deployable unit are already deployed. It iterates through all component IDs and verifies their presence in the deployed components list. If duplicates are found, it logs warning messages for each duplicate component and returns true. If no duplicates exist, it returns false.
7089	Returns a collection of management actions for installation, including post-install actions (executed first) followed by regular install actions.
7090	Returns a collection of uninstall management actions, ensuring that uninstall actions for deployment units are executed last, followed by any remaining uninstall actions for components not associated with deployment units.

7092	Closes a profile by invoking the close MBean operation asynchronously in a separate thread.
7093	Returns an ObjectName for a ProfileMBean with the specified profile table name and profile name, using JMX ObjectName quoting for safe handling of special characters in the names.
7094	Changes the profile state to read-write if it's currently read-only, making the profile object writable and updating the state accordingly. If the profile is already in write state, it logs a debug message indicating the current state.
7095	Method `beforeSetCmpField` is called before setting a component field. It first logs debug information about the operation on a specific profile and table. If the profile is writable, it attempts to resume a transaction using the SLEE container's transaction manager. If transaction resumption fails, it throws a `ManagementException`. If the profile is not writable, it throws an `InvalidStateException`.
7096	Method `afterSetCmpField()` is called after setting a component field in a profile. It logs debug information about the profile and table, then attempts to suspend the current transaction using the SLEE container's transaction manager. If transaction suspension fails, it throws a ManagementException wrapping the original exception.
7097	beforeGetCmpField() is a protected method that performs pre-processing before getting a comparison field. It logs debug information containing the profile name and table name, then delegates to beforeNonSetCmpField() and returns its result. The method throws ManagementException if the pre-processing fails.
7098	Method `afterGetCmpField` is called after a CMP (Container Managed Persistence) field is accessed. It logs debug information including the activation status and profile details, then delegates to `afterNonSetCmpField` for further processing. The method takes a boolean parameter indicating whether a transaction was activated and throws a `ManagementException` if an error occurs.
7099	Method `beforeManagementMethodInvocation()` is called prior to management method execution. It first logs a debug message containing profile name and table information, then retrieves the JNDI management component from the SLEE container and pushes the JNDI context for the profile specification component. Finally, it delegates to `beforeNonSetCmpField()` and returns its result. This method is responsible for setting up the JNDI context before management operations are performed on a profile.
7100	Method called after a management method invocation to perform cleanup operations. It logs debug information, executes post-processing logic for non-SET CMP fields, and pops the JNDI context from the stack.
7101	Deletes a file or directory and all its contents recursively.
7102	Creates a default constructor for the SBB concrete class that does nothing, which is needed for convergence name creation during deployment.
7103	Creates a default usage parameter getter method in the concrete SBB class by copying from abstract methods and setting up the method body to call a handler method.

1. Retrieving the class pool and abstract SBB class name from the component
2. Loading the abstract SBB class and handling not-found exceptions
3. Identifying and storing concrete methods (non-abstract, non-native) in a map
4. Decorating EJB ENC bind calls and new thread calls
5. If decoration occurred, writing the modified class to the deployment directory and returning true
6. If no decoration occurred, returning false

The method throws `DeploymentException` if the abstract SBB class cannot be found, and `SLEEException` for other errors during file writing. The decorated class is detached from the class pool after writing and defrosted in the finally block.
7111	Invokes a method on the given proxy and discards the return value.
7112	Returns the real field name by looking up aliases in the SBB descriptor, or creates a new alias based on the SBB ID if none exists.
7113	Sets a field value in the activity context data attributes using the real field name derived from the provided field name.
7114	Returns the value of a field by its name, with special handling for primitive types. If the field value is null and the return type is primitive, it returns the default value for that primitive type (0 for numbers, false for boolean). Otherwise, it returns the actual field value.
7115	Sets the profile context for this profile object, throwing exceptions for null context or incorrect state. It also invokes setProfileContext on the concrete profile implementation if configured to do so, handling class loader context and security manager considerations. Finally, it updates the profile object's state to POOLED.
7116	Initializes a profile with the given name, creating a new profile entity or cloning from default profile, sets initial state and marks entity as dirty for creation.
7117	Method: unsetProfileContext

Summary: Clears the profile context for a pooled profile object by invoking the unsetProfileContext() method on the profile concrete object, resetting the state to DOES_NOT_EXIST. The method temporarily switches the thread's context class loader during execution for security purposes, handles RuntimeExceptions from profile invocations, and ensures the original class loader is restored in a finally block. The operation only executes when the profile object is in POOLED state and the profile specification component allows unsetProfileContext operations.
7118	Returns a ProfileLocalObject instance based on the profile specification component's concrete class, creating a new ProfileLocalObjectImpl if no concrete class is specified, or instantiating the specified concrete class using reflection with this object as a parameter. Throws SLEEException if instantiation fails.
7119	Fires a profile added or updated event if the profile object is in READY state, dirty, and the table is configured to fire events, but only if the profile has a name and the SLEE container is running. The event is fired on the activity context associated with the profile table.
7120	Returns the profile comparison wrapper instance, creating it if necessary using reflection with the current instance as constructor parameter.
7121	Creates a new CtClass with the specified class name and optional interfaces. Throws NullPointerException if class name is null. Sets the interfaces on the created class if provided. Returns the created CtClass instance.

7126	Returns the ClassPool instance for this component, initializing it if necessary. Throws IllegalStateException if no class loader is set. Configures the ClassPool with class paths from the domain, its dependencies, and the parent class loader.
7127	Sets the deployable unit for this component. Throws AlreadyDeployedException if the deployable unit cannot be installed due to multiple components with the same ID. Throws IllegalStateException if a deployable unit is already set.
7128	Method `undeployed()` clears and resets all resource references by setting classLoader, classLoaderDomain, classPool, and permissions to null, while also cleaning up and clearing the classPool and permissions collections.
7129	Starts an activity within a transaction context, with optional suspension and garbage collection callback handling.
7130	Method `checkInterfaces` recursively searches for a specified interface within a class hierarchy. It first checks if the input class directly implements the searched interface. If not, it examines all directly implemented interfaces. If the interface isn't found among direct interfaces, it recursively searches through the class's superclasses. The method returns the found interface class or null if not found.
7131	Returns a map of all interface methods from the given interface class and its superinterfaces, excluding those specified in the ignore set. The map uses method keys as keys and Method objects as values.
7132	Method that resolves external entities by looking up a public ID in resources map and returning an InputSource with the corresponding resource stream, or null if not found.
7133	Validates that a tracer name follows proper naming conventions, throwing IllegalArgumentException for invalid names containing illegal characters or formatting issues.
7134	Returns a collection of profile objects by executing a static query on the profile table with the specified query name and arguments.

7136	Creates a temporary directory for Deployable Unit (DU) deployment by:
1. Generating a unique temporary file in the deployment root
2. Creating a corresponding directory with "-contents" suffix
3. Ensuring the directory doesn't already exist
4. Deleting the temporary file
5. Returning the newly created deployment directory

Handles IOException by throwing SLEEException with appropriate error message.
7137	Returns the EntityManager associated with the current transaction context, creating a new one if necessary. Uses a transaction data key based on the component's profile specification ID to store and retrieve the EntityManager from the transaction context. If a new EntityManager is created, it's stored in the transaction context data and configured to close before transaction commits.

7176	Creates a RegionRequest instance from a string representation, supporting "full", "square", and coordinate-based formats with optional BigDecimal precision.
7177	Returns the region as a Rectangle2D object. If the region is relative, it converts the relativeBox values to double precision and creates a new Rectangle2D.Double. If the region is absolute, it returns the absoluteBox directly.
7178	Method `resolve` takes an image dimension and returns a rectangle based on the object's configuration. If the object is configured as square, it centers the square within the image. If no box is specified, it returns the full image rectangle. For relative boxes, it converts percentages to absolute pixels. For absolute boxes, it uses them directly. The method ensures the resulting rectangle fits within the image bounds, adjusting width and height if necessary, and throws an exception if the rectangle's position exceeds the image dimensions.
7179	Method that determines the "on" type for an annotation by first checking if the current annotation has a painting motivation, and if not, walks up the JSON parsing context to find the parent IIIF resource type.

It uses a sub-range map to efficiently handle multiple character ranges, avoiding repeated lookups. For each range found, it adjusts bounds based on open/closed interval types, allocates a new subcolor for the range, and creates a new NFA arc with the specified parameters.

The method handles concurrent modification issues by copying the ranges before processing, and manages range bounds carefully to ensure proper character interval handling. It's designed for complex regex patterns where ranges might overlap or require color-based state management.

**Parameters:**
- `from`: Start of character range (inclusive)
- `to`: End of character range (inclusive) 
- `lp`: Left state for NFA arc
- `rp`: Right state for NFA arc

1. If descriptor is unused, skip it
2. If has no subcolor, do nothing
3. If is a subcolor (points to itself), let parent handle it
4. If parent is empty and has no characters:
   - Remove subcolor relationship
   - Move parent's arcs to subcolor
   - Update arc colors and chains
   - Free the color
5. If parent has characters:
   - Remove subcolor relationship

2. Handles special "***" sequences (error, literal string, or ARE mode)
3. For advanced regex patterns, processes embedded options in the form "(?x)" where x is a letter flag
4. Updates compilation flags based on encountered options
5. Throws exceptions for invalid or unsupported patterns/options
6. Supports various flags like REG_ICASE, REG_EXTENDED, REG_NEWLINE, etc.

7819	Dumps the NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) state information for debugging purposes. The method logs debug information including state counts, initial and final states, boundary markers (bos, bol, eos, eol), and iterates through all states to dump their details. If the NFA has no parent, it also dumps color information. The output is only generated when debug logging is enabled.
7820	Dumps debugging information about a state, including its number, temporary flag, flag character, state chain validity, outgoing arcs, and incoming links. Returns early if debug logging is disabled.
7821	Method `dumparcs` prints arcs from a state in reverse order to a StringBuilder.

7824	Method `optimize()` performs a series of regex optimization steps: cleans up the initial state, removes EMPTY arcs, handles constraints by pulling them back and pushing them forward, performs final cleanup, and returns the analysis result.
7825	This method analyzes arc connections between pre and post states to detect specific pattern matches. It returns REG_UIMPOSSIBLE if pre.outs is null, REG_UEMPTYMATCH if a direct connection from pre.outs to post is found through intermediate arcs, or 0 if no such pattern is detected. The method uses nested loops to traverse arc chains and check for connections between the pre state's output arcs and the post state.
7826	This method combines two Arc objects (con and a) and returns an integer result based on their compatibility. It uses a switch statement to evaluate the combination of arc types, where each arc type is represented as a byte value. The method handles various combinations of constraints including '^', '$', Compiler.AHEAD, Compiler.BEHIND, and Compiler.LACON. It returns INCOMPATIBLE for conflicting constraint combinations, SATISFIED for compatible identical constraints, and COMPATIBLE for most other combinations. The method throws a RegexException for impossible arc combinations. The primary purpose is to determine if two arc constraints can be satisfied together in a regex pattern.
7827	This method performs cleanup of states by:
1. Marking reachable states using `markreachable` and `markcanreach`
2. Removing unreachable or dead-end states that don't meet reachability criteria
3. Clearing traversal marks with `cleartraverse`
4. Renumbering surviving states sequentially by assigning incrementing numbers
5. Updating the total state count

The cleanup process ensures only reachable states remain in the state list, with proper renumbering of the remaining states.
7828	Marks all reachable states from a given state by performing a depth-first traversal of the state machine graph, using temporary markings to track visited states and avoid infinite recursion.
7829	Mark all states that can reach a given state by traversing incoming arcs in a graph, using temporary marking to track visited nodes during depth-first traversal.
7830	Summary: The `fixempties` method eliminates empty transitions (epsilon transitions) from an NFA until no more can be removed. It iterates through all states and their outgoing arcs, identifies empty transitions using the `unempty` method, and continues processing until no progress is made in removing empty transitions. When progress is made, it dumps the current NFA state.
7831	The `unempty` method handles the removal of empty arcs in a state machine by merging states. It determines whether to work on the 'from' or 'to' state based on which has fewer connections, then either moves or copies arcs between states, finally freeing the removed arc. If the arc is a self-loop, it simply frees the arc and returns true. The method returns true to indicate successful processing.

7871	Resolves a variable by its name using the EL context and resolver, returning the variable's value or throwing an ELException if resolution fails.
7872	Parse a JSP or tag file and return the root of the node tree. If the file is a tag file, the JAR file containing the tag file is determined from the context. The parsing is done by calling doParse with the input file name and the JAR file URL. If the file is not a tag file, the JAR file URL is null.
7873	Method: parse

7883	Paginates a full dataset into chunks of specified page size, returning a PaginationResult containing the current page of results and pagination metadata. The method takes a starting page number and page size, then uses a provided data accessor function to retrieve the appropriate subset of data from the full dataset. It handles cases where the start position exceeds the dataset length by returning an empty list. The pagination is 0-indexed, and the returned result includes the paginated data along with information about the pagination state.

First checks if the tag file already exists in the super class, and if not, looks up the path in tagFileMap. If found, parses the tag file directives using TagFileProcessor, creates a new TagFileInfo, adds it to the vector, and updates the tagFiles array. Returns the TagFileInfo or null if not found.
7887	Parses an implicit TLD (Tag Library Descriptor) file to extract version information and validate its contents. The method reads the TLD from the specified path, parses its XML structure, extracts the JSP version and tag library version, and ensures the JSP version is 2.0 or greater. It handles exceptions during parsing and resource access, and throws JasperException for errors. The method also validates that only allowed elements are present in the implicit TLD file.

In case of compilation errors, it prints the error message and exits with an appropriate error code if specified.
7960	Sets the URI root path, converting it to canonical form if possible, otherwise keeping the original string.
7961	Scans files recursively starting from the given base directory, collecting JSP files based on specified extensions or JSP configuration. The method traverses directories using a stack-based approach, checking each file against configured extensions ("jsp", "jspx" by default) or JSP configuration rules to determine if it should be added to the pages collection.
7962	Finds the URI root directory for a given file by searching up the directory tree for a "WEB-INF" directory.

7965	Method Summary:
The `matches` method checks if the current input stream matches a given string exactly. It works by:

1. Saving the current position with `mark()`
2. Reading characters one by one and comparing them with the target string
3. If any character doesn't match, it resets to the saved position and returns false
4. If all characters match, it returns true
5. Throws `JasperException` if there's an error during character reading

The method is case-sensitive and will only return true if the exact string appears at the current position in the input stream.
7966	Matches an optional string with spaces before it. Skips optional whitespace, attempts to match the specified string, and backtracks if the match fails. Returns true if the string is found (with optional preceding spaces), false otherwise.
7967	Skip characters in input stream until a specific limit string is found, returning a mark at the start of the limit string or null if not found.
7968	Method `skipUntilIgnoreEsc` skips characters in input until it finds a specified limit string, ignoring escape sequences (backslash-escaped characters). It returns a Mark object pointing to the position before the limit string is found, or null if the limit is not found. The method handles double backslashes correctly and ensures that backslash-escaped characters are not treated as literal characters when matching the limit string.
7969	Skips input until the specified end tag is found, returns Mark if found and properly closed, null otherwise.
7970	Parses a token from the input, handling quoted strings by consuming characters until the matching quote is found, or until a delimiter is encountered for unquoted tokens. Returns the parsed token as a string.
7971	Pops the current file from the stack and restores the previous parser state. Returns true if successful, false if the stack is empty or file is not registered. Restores master directory and current position, handles error reporting for unregistered files.
7972	Returns a new Coordinates object with the classifier set to null, effectively making it unclassified. If the current object has no classifier, returns itself.
7973	Filters a list of AspectInformation objects based on a factory ID predicate, returning a new list containing only elements where the predicate test passes for the factory ID. Returns null if the input list is null.
7974	Returns an array of factory IDs representing the missing required aspects by comparing assigned aspects with required aspects.
7975	Sets the schema resource prefix and updates cached schema resource paths. If the prefix starts with "file:", it URL-encodes the prefix and marks it as a file URL. Otherwise, it uses the prefix as-is. Then updates the cached paths by prepending the schema resource prefix to each default schema resource path.
7976	Sets the DTD resource prefix and updates cached DTD resource paths. If the prefix starts with "file:", it URL-encodes the prefix and marks it as a file URL. Otherwise, it uses the prefix as-is. The method also updates the cached DTD resource paths by prepending the prefix to the filename portion of the default paths.
7977	Encodes a file path prefix by URL-encoding non-separator components while preserving directory separators and colons. Returns the encoded string if the prefix starts with "file:", otherwise returns the original prefix unchanged.
7978	Converts an XML Node into a TreeNode structure, including all attributes and non-comment children, while preserving the hierarchical relationship between parent and child nodes.
7979	Merges validation errors from one BindingResult into another, recursively handling nested child BindingResults.
7980	Initializes a binder by finding all methods annotated with `Binder.Initializer` and invoking them through a binding call. Throws a `RuntimeException` if any initialization method fails.
7981	Scans for ChannelAspectFactory services in the given BundleContext and returns a Map of ChannelAspectInformation objects keyed by their factory IDs. Returns an empty map if no services are found or if an invalid filter syntax is encountered (though the latter should never occur since no filter is specified).
7982	Returns the filename part of a path by extracting everything after the last forward slash.
7983	Invokes a plugin for a custom tag node by retrieving the appropriate TagPlugin, creating a context, setting it on the node, and executing the plugin's doTag method.
7984	Returns a byte array of specified size from cache if available, otherwise creates a new array. If fillWithZeros is true and array is retrieved from cache, fills it with zeros.
7985	Returns an integer array of the specified size, optionally filled with zeros. Uses a cache to reuse arrays when possible, creates a new array if cache is empty, and fills with zeros if requested.
7986	Converts a collection of artifact results into an AetherResult object, populating it with resolved artifacts, their coordinates, resolution status, request status, optional status, and any errors encountered during resolution.
7987	Returns an InputStream for the given URI by first trying to find the resource on the filesystem, and if not found, falls back to the context's getResourceAsStream method.
7988	Validates a PageData object using the tag library validator, returning validation messages or null if no validator is available. The method prepares the URI by prefixing it with a specific urn if it starts with "/", then calls the validator and releases it before returning the results.
7989	Pushes current stream state to stack and initializes new stream with provided parameters.
7990	Returns the encoding detected from a JSP file stream, given its filename, jar file context, and error dispatcher. The method retrieves an input stream for the file, uses an XML encoding detector to determine the encoding, and then closes the input stream before returning the encoding result.
7991	Scans for an XML declaration in the input, handling both special cases where the declaration starts with "xml" followed by a name character, and standard XML declarations. If an XML declaration is found, it increments the markup depth and processes the declaration accordingly.
7992	Reports a fatal error by invoking the error handler with the specified message ID and argument, then throws a JasperException.
7993	Returns the real file system path for a given URL path by converting the resource file path to the local file system format, or null if the operation fails or the protocol is not "file".

7998	Adds a filter with the specified name, description, class name, and initialization parameters. Currently implements no functionality beyond a placeholder return statement.
7999	Calculates buffer size needed for compression/decompression by summing up the size before dictionary, size after matches, and a reserved size based on dictionary size with a maximum limit.
8000	Returns the estimated memory usage in kilobytes for the compression algorithm based on dictionary size, extra sizes, maximum match length, and match finding method.
8001	Sets a preset dictionary for compression. Copies the specified number of bytes from the preset dictionary to the internal buffer, starting from the tail of the preset dictionary if it's larger than the specified dictionary size. The copy size is limited to the minimum of the preset dictionary length and the specified dictionary size. The write position and skip parameters are updated accordingly. Precondition: The compressor must not have started and the write position must be 0.
8002	Moves window data aligning to 16-byte multiple for LZMA2 compression format compatibility.
8003	Fills the compression window with input data, manages buffer sliding, and returns the number of bytes actually copied.
8004	Process pending bytes by running them through the match finder when enough new data is available, ensuring efficient encoding without wasting time on repeated pending byte processing.
8005	Returns the length of the match between data at the current read position and data at a specified backward distance in the buffer.
8006	Returns the length of the match between data at current position and data at a backward distance, up to a specified limit.
8007	Verifies that the matches object contains valid match lengths by comparing computed lengths against expected lengths, returning true if all matches are valid.
8008	The `movePos` method advances a read position and calculates available space between write and read positions. It takes two parameters: `requiredForFlushing` and `requiredForFinishing`, asserting that flushing requirement is greater than or equal to finishing requirement. The method increments `readPos` and computes available space. If available space is insufficient for flushing, it checks if space is also insufficient for finishing or if not in finishing state - if so, it increments `pendingSize` and sets available space to 0. The method returns the calculated available space.
8009	Resets the object state by clearing flags, nullifying references, and releasing character buffer resources.
8010	Flushes the internal buffer by writing its contents to the output stream and resetting the buffer position.
8011	Clears the buffer content, throwing IllegalStateException if called after unbuffered output or after flushing, and ensures the buffer is open before resetting the position to the offset.
8012	Flushes the output buffer and ensures response headers are sent. If the output stream is available, it flushes the stream. Otherwise, it sets the character encoding and flushes the response buffer to ensure headers are sent.
8013	Closes the response by flushing any buffered data, closing the output stream, and marking the response as closed. Multiple calls to close are allowed and will be ignored.
8014	Writes data to the output stream, handling byte arrays and strings appropriately based on buffer settings and initialization status.
8015	Allocates a character buffer based on the buffer size, using either a direct CharBuffer allocation or a thread-local pool allocation depending on the size relative to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE.

8613	Inserts a template from a source configuration range into a target sheet at a specified position, copying rows and mapping static rows for configuration purposes.
8614	Evaluates normal cells by checking if the string value contains a method prefix, then evaluates the expression, sets the cell value to the result, and creates a tie cell.
8615	This method evaluates a user formula by extracting the formula string from a given cell value and setting it as the cell's formula. It takes the substring between the second and second-to-last characters of the input string, and if the resulting formula string is not null or empty, it sets this formula on the provided cell.
8616	Returns true if the given string starts with the user formula prefix and ends with the user formula suffix, indicating it is a user formula.
8617	Creates a cell comment by storing it in a map for later batch processing due to POI library limitations that require comments to be set in sorted order (row-first, then column). The comment is only added to the map if it's not null.

9471	This method resolves external entity references for XML parsing by mapping public and system IDs to their corresponding URIs. It first checks if a system ID or public ID exists in predefined maps, then creates an InputSource with the resolved URI. To work around a bug in Xerces that causes incorrect system identifier handling, it also opens the InputStream for the resolved URI and sets it on the InputSource. If resolution fails or no mapping is found, it returns null. The method handles exceptions gracefully by returning null when the URL cannot be opened or resolved.
9472	Resolves a URI reference by mapping it to an absolute URI, handling both direct mappings and URL resolution relative to a base URI. If the href contains a fragment identifier, it is stripped before resolution. The method attempts to find a pre-mapped result in uriMap, and if not found, constructs an absolute URL using either the provided base or creates one from the href. If URL construction fails, it attempts to make the base absolute and recursively resolve the URI. Finally, it wraps the resolved URI in a SAXSource with an InputSource for XML processing.
9473	Converts a URI string to an absolute URL by first attempting to create a URL object from the URI. If that fails due to a MalformedURLException, it tries to construct an absolute file URL using the user's current directory. If both attempts fail, it returns the original URI unchanged.

9485	Adds an incoming edge to this vertex from the specified vertex with the given cost.
9486	Returns true if this vertex contains the given edge, false otherwise. Checks if the edge's source vertex is this vertex and the edge is in outgoing edges, or if the edge's target vertex is this vertex and the edge is in incoming edges.
9487	Removes an edge from either the incoming edges list or outgoing edges list based on whether this node is the from node or to node of the edge. Returns true if the edge was successfully removed, false if the edge doesn't belong to this node.
9488	Finds and returns the first outgoing edge that connects to the specified destination vertex, or null if no such edge exists.
9489	Returns the edge if it exists in outgoingEdges, otherwise returns null.
9490	Returns the cost to reach the destination vertex from this vertex. If the destination is the same vertex, returns 0. If there is no direct edge to the destination, returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. Otherwise, returns the cost of the direct edge.
9491	Method `jar` recursively processes a source file or directory to create a JAR archive entry. If the source is a directory, it creates a directory entry in the JAR and recursively processes its contents. If the source is a file, it reads the file content and writes it as a file entry in the JAR. The method uses a provided `JarOutputStream` and `JarInfo` object containing the output stream, buffer, and file filter. It sets appropriate entry properties including timestamps and uses STORED method for directories and automatic compression for files.
9492	Returns true if there are more elements available across all nested iterators, false otherwise. Checks each iterator in the array starting from the current index until it finds an iterator with remaining elements or reaches the end of the array.

9904	Sets the polymer elements based on the type of polymerID, creating either a PolymerListElements or PolymerSingleElements object.
9905	This method converts a HELM string to V2.0 format. It first attempts to parse the input string with "V2.0" suffix. If parsing fails, it manually processes the string by:

1. Adding a "f" character to create a workable format
2. Splitting the string by "}$" delimiter into sections
3. Processing sections to reconstruct the HELM notation:
   - Preserves the first section unchanged
   - Handles connection sections (sections 2)
   - Adds hydrogen bonds (section 3) with proper formatting
   - Adds annotation sections (section 4)
4. Appends "$V2.0" to indicate HELM2 notation

Description: Sends a subscribe count request with the specified pattern to the server and waits for a response. The method constructs an Erlang message containing the subscribe_count command and pattern, sends it, then polls for the response. If successful, it returns the subscription count; otherwise, it returns -1 after printing the stack trace of any decoding exception.
9922	Removes the first callback for a given pattern and sends an unsubscribe message. Throws InvalidInputException if pattern is not found. If no callbacks remain after removal, the pattern is completely unsubscribed.
9923	This method handles both synchronous and asynchronous responses based on the request type. It delegates to `return_async()` for async requests and `return_sync()` for sync requests, throwing an exception for invalid request types.
9924	Sends a synchronous return message with specified parameters including name, pattern, response information, response data, timeout, transaction ID, and process ID, throwing a ReturnSyncException upon completion.
9925	Polls for a message with the specified timeout. Returns true if a message is available, false otherwise. Throws exceptions for invalid input, message decoding errors, or termination conditions.
9926	Shuts down the connection with a reason message by writing a shutdown tuple to the output stream and sending it.
9927	Returns the exception if it requires non-local handling, otherwise throws it unchecked.
9928	Method unlocks the run state by performing a compare-and-swap operation. If the CAS fails, it directly sets the run state and notifies all waiting threads if a steal counter lock exists.
9929	Creates a new worker thread using the thread factory, starts it, and returns true if successful. If creation or startup fails, deregisters the worker and returns false.
9930	Attempts to add a new worker thread by atomically updating the control state, creating the worker if successful. Returns early if the pool is terminating.
9931	Registers a new worker thread in the fork/join pool by creating a WorkQueue for it, assigning it an index in the work queues array with collision resolution, setting thread properties, and returning the created WorkQueue.
9932	Deregisters a worker thread from the fork-join pool, removes its work queue from the pool's array, decrements worker counts, transfers steal counts, cancels remaining tasks, and attempts to replace the worker if needed. If an exception occurs, it rethrows it; otherwise, it helps clean up stale exceptions before returning.
9933	Signals work to be processed by activating an idle worker thread. Attempts to activate an idle worker by updating control state and unparking the worker's thread. If no idle workers exist, tries to add a new worker if necessary. Returns early if the system is unstarted, terminated, or if the current work queue has no pending work. Uses compare-and-swap operations to safely update worker state and avoid race conditions.
9934	Runs a worker thread that executes tasks from the work queue using a work-stealing algorithm with xorshift randomization.
9935	Waits for work in a work-stealing pool, handling thread parking and spinning logic. Returns false if the work queue is terminating, otherwise returns true when work is available or the operation is interrupted.
9936	Returns the surplus queued task count for the current ForkJoinWorkerThread, or 0 if not running in a ForkJoinWorkerThread. The calculation determines the difference between the number of tasks in the worker's queue and a threshold based on the pool's configuration and active threads.
9937	Returns the work queue from the common ForkJoinPool for submission, or null if the common pool is not available. The queue is selected using a random probe value for load balancing.
9938	Returns the result of helping complete a task in the work queue, or 0 if work queues are not initialized.
9939	Submits a ForkJoinTask for execution and returns the task itself. Throws NullPointerException if the task is null. Uses externalPush to add the task to the work queue.
9940	Creates and configures a common ForkJoinPool using system properties for configuration, with default settings based on available processors if no properties are specified.
9941	Gets the result of this task, waiting up to the specified timeout if necessary. Returns the result upon success, or throws an exception upon failure. This method supports timeouts and can be interrupted. It handles various completion states including normal completion, cancellation, and exceptions.

9946	Returns true if the given predicate returns true for every element in the collection, false otherwise. Throws the exception type E if the predicate throws it.
9947	Folds an iterable from left to right using a binary function, accumulating results starting with a given value.
9948	Folds a list from right to left using the provided function, starting with a seed value. Processes elements in reverse order using a ListIterator.

9956	Normalizes a resource name by converting it to a classpath resource if it starts with "//", or extracting the filename portion from a URL-like resource name.
9957	This method marshals a BoundType value to a String representation. It first validates that the input type is a user-defined value type, then attempts to convert it using a registered converter. If conversion fails or no converter is found, it falls back to the default toString() method. The method throws an IllegalArgumentException for non-user-defined value types.
9958	Returns a CharSequence subsequence from the specified start index to end index by creating a new StringBuilder and appending the array elements from start with given length.
9959	Creates a BinarySearch instance for a given list that implements Comparable elements, providing comparison and index access functionality through anonymous inner class implementation.

9962	Sends an email message either asynchronously or synchronously based on the asynchronousSend flag. Returns a Future<Boolean> indicating success or failure of the send operation. In asynchronous mode, uses an executor to send the email in background and returns immediately with a Future. In synchronous mode, sends the email immediately on the current thread and returns a completed Future. Both modes set the email's sent date and handle exceptions by logging errors and returning false/failed state.
9963	Binds a route handler to the router by registering it for specified versions and HTTP methods, creating binding keys and adding pattern routes to the route bindings map.
9964	Binds a filter handler to the specified path and method(s), registering it with version information. If no versions are provided, uses the default version. For each version and method combination, it creates a binding key and registers the handler with the appropriate pattern filter bindings, merging handlers with matching patterns.
9965	This method checks if the current subject (user) has any of the specified roles. It splits the role string by commas and iterates through each role, using the subject's `hasRole` method to check if the user possesses that role. If any role matches, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The method handles null subjects gracefully by returning false if no subject is available.
9966	Returns the integer value of a Long object, or 0 if the Long is null or greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE.
9967	Removes duplicate strings from an array while maintaining sorted order, returning a new array with unique elements.

Returns true if they match, false otherwise.
9974	Saves a user member in a cookie for authentication purposes. Generates a login key using user data and request information, then sets a cookie with this key. If the 'save' parameter is true, the cookie has a maximum age (persistent login), otherwise it's session-only (-1). Previously existing login cookies are deleted before setting the new one.
9975	Returns an encrypted login key string composed of user identifier, password, IP address, user agent hash, and timestamp.

10139	The method `replaceSlashWithHyphen` replaces all forward slashes ('/') in a given string with hyphens ('-'). It converts the input string to a character array, iterates through the array (excluding the last character), and replaces any slash with a hyphen. Finally, it returns a new string created from the modified character array, but only up to the second-to-last character (which appears to be a bug, as it excludes the last character unnecessarily).

**Note:** There's a bug in the code - it returns `new String(resulltChars, 0, resulltChars.length - 1)` which excludes the last character of the original string, likely intended to be `new String(resulltChars, 0, resulltChars.length)`.

The method returns null if no unification is possible, or a list of bound variables if successful.
10224	Method `unifyInternal` attempts to unify two terms by recursively checking their structure and handling different term types (variables, constants, functors). It returns `true` if unification is successful, `false` otherwise. The method handles cases where terms are identical, both constants, left or right is a variable, or both are functors with matching names and arities by recursively unifying their arguments.
10225	**Summary:**

The `unifyVar` method handles unification between a variable and a term in a logic programming context. It performs the following steps:

1. If the left variable is already bound, it unifies the bound value with the right term
2. If the right term is a bound variable, it unifies the left variable with the value of the right term  
3. Otherwise, it binds the left variable to the right term and adds the variable to the left trail for backtracking

The method returns `true` if unification succeeds, and handles various cases including bound variables, free variables, and term substitution while maintaining trail information for potential backtracking.

10296	Consumes and returns the next token from the token source if it matches the expected kind, otherwise throws a SourceCodeException with detailed error information including the expected and actual tokens and their positions.
10297	Method `peekAndConsume(int kind)` checks if the next token in the token source matches the specified kind. If it matches, the token is consumed and the method returns true. If it doesn't match, the method returns false. If consuming the token throws a SourceCodeException, an IllegalStateException is thrown instead.

10312	Reads bytes from the source into the provided byte array and returns a ByteBlock containing the read data.
10313	Method `applyWithEntry` attempts to insert a key-value entry into a hash table using cuckoo hashing. It first checks if an entry for the key already exists and returns its sequence number. If not, it creates a new entry with an incremented sequence number and tries to insert it. If insertion fails due to collisions, it attempts rehashing if enabled. Returns the sequence number of the inserted entry, -1 for existing entries, or null if insertion fails.

10315	This method implements the cuckoo hashing collision resolution algorithm. It takes an entry and attempts to place it in the hash table using cuckoo hashing principles, where displaced entries are recursively moved to their alternative hash locations. The method returns the entry that couldn't be placed (if any) or null if successful. It includes cycle detection to prevent infinite loops during the rehashing process.
10316	Method rehash() increases the hash table size when load factor exceeds 0.5, doubles the size if necessary, and rehashes all entries using new hash functions until successful.

It maintains two queues (forward and reverse) and two fringe maps to track explored states from both directions. The search alternates between expanding nodes from the forward queue (starting from the initial state) and the reverse queue (starting from the goal state). When a node from one direction matches a node from the opposite direction, it calls `joinBothPaths` to combine the paths and returns the complete path. If no path is found, it returns null.

10394	**Summary:**

The `resolveCallPoint` method looks up a `WAMCallPoint` object in the symbol table using the provided functor name as the key. If no entry exists for the functor name, it creates a new `WAMCallPoint` with default values (-1, 0, and the provided functor name) and returns it. The method ensures a valid `WAMCallPoint` is always returned, either from the symbol table or as a newly created instance.
10395	Sets a code address in the symbol table with the given functor name, offset, and length, and maintains a reverse lookup table from address to functor name. Returns the created WAMCallPoint entry.
10396	Checks if this hierarchy attribute is a parent category of the given comparator attribute by verifying they are of the same type, the comparator's path is longer, and all path labels match up to this attribute's path length.
10397	Returns the ID from the category element by looking up the value in the attribute class lookup tree.
10398	Returns the value at the specified level by first finding the index of the level in the attribute class's levels list, then calling getValueAtLevel with that index. Throws IllegalArgumentException if the level name is not found in the hierarchy.
10399	Returns the last element from the list of path values obtained by calling getPathValue().
10400	This method customizes the serialization of an object by writing its hierarchical path and attribute class information to the output stream instead of using default serialization. It writes the object's path as a string array and the fully qualified name of its attribute class as a string.
10401	This method performs custom deserialization of a HierarchyAttribute object. It reads the attribute's value representation (as a String array) and class name from the input stream, reconstructs the attribute using a factory pattern, and copies the reconstructed attribute's fields (value and attributeClass) into the current object. The method also includes commented-out logging code that would display information about the deserialized object and associated attribute classes.
10402	This method computes the heuristic value (h) for an 8-puzzle state using Manhattan distance. It handles two cases:

1. **Start state** (no parent): Calculates the complete Manhattan distance by summing the distances of all tiles from their goal positions.

2. **Subsequent states** (with parent): Incrementally updates the heuristic from the parent node by:
   - Identifying which tile was moved based on the empty tile's position
   - Calculating how the moved tile's Manhattan distance changed
   - Adjusting the parent heuristic by +1 or -1 based on whether the tile moved closer to or further from its goal

The method returns the heuristic value as a float.
10403	Returns the modular arithmetic result of `c` modulo `bucketSize`, handling negative numbers correctly by ensuring the result is always non-negative.
10404	Adds an error message with the specified key and user-friendly message to the errors collection.
10405	Handles exceptions by logging them, unwrapping wrapped exceptions, adding stack trace to errors for debugging, and adding user-readable error messages when applicable, defaulting to internal error message for non-user-readable exceptions.
10406	Writes a string to the output stream, replacing newline characters with HTML <br> tags.
10407	This method classifies a given state by traversing a decision tree from root to leaf nodes. It starts at the root decision tree node and follows decisions based on the state properties until it reaches a leaf node containing an assignment. The method handles three node types: Decision nodes (which guide traversal), Assignment nodes (which provide the final classification result), and Pending nodes (which cause classification failures). It returns a map containing the classified property name and its corresponding ordinal attribute value. The method throws a ClassifyingFailureException if it encounters an invalid node type or if the decision tree traversal fails due to missing properties or type mismatches.
10408	This method implements a comparison between two elements `a` and `b` using a partial ordering relationship. It first checks if `a` is related to `b` through `partialOrdering.evaluate(a, b)`. If not, it returns -1. Otherwise, it also checks if `b` is related to `a` and returns 0 if both relationships exist (meaning they are equivalent in the partial order), or 1 if only the first relationship exists (meaning `a` is greater than `b` in the partial order).
10409	Returns an iterator over the elements in this list. Wraps the underlying iterator in a distributed iterator implementation and returns a client iterator. If a RemoteException occurs during the process, it is wrapped in an IllegalStateException and rethrown to avoid conflicting with the ArrayList interface.

10414	Returns the base-10 logarithm of a long integer, rounded down to the nearest integer. Handles values from 0 to 9223372036854775807 (Long.MAX_VALUE) by using a series of conditional checks for powers of 10, returning 0 for values less than 10, 1 for values less than 100, and so on up to 18 for values less than 10^19.
10415	Returns the integer logarithm base 10 of a long value by comparing against powers of 10.
10416	Returns the number of characters needed to represent an int32 value as a string, including the negative sign for negative numbers. For positive numbers, it uses the unsigned character count method. For negative numbers, it adds 1 for the negative sign to the character count of the absolute value. Special handling for Integer.MIN_VALUE to avoid overflow when negating.
10417	Returns the number of characters needed to represent a long integer value in decimal notation, including the negative sign for negative numbers. For positive numbers, it uses the unsigned character count method. For negative numbers, it accounts for the minus sign by adding 1 to the character count of the absolute value. Special handling is included for Long.MIN_VALUE to avoid overflow when taking the absolute value.
10418	Calculates the total number of characters needed to represent a decimal number with specified scale, including digits, decimal point, and leading/trailing zeros.

10423	Returns the value of a property identified by its key, along with the calling class name and method name obtained from the stack trace.
10424	Returns an array of properties for the given key, using the calling class name and method name obtained from the stack trace.
10425	Returns an Iterator that generates keys in a specific order based on environment, base, and modifier components. The iterator cycles through predefined ORDER patterns, combining the components according to bit flags (E, B, M) to create key strings.

10426	Creates array properties from regular properties by parsing keys that end with integers, organizing them into arrays indexed by the integer suffix.
10427	Sets the throttle rate in hertz, validates it's positive, calculates the cycle time in nanoseconds, and resets initialization flags.
10428	Returns the negation of the input number, preserving its numeric type (integer or real) by using appropriate arithmetic operations for each type.
10429	Method `findProperties` attempts to load properties from multiple sources in a specific order: first from a file referenced by a system property, then from the classpath, and finally from the current working directory. It returns immediately upon successfully loading properties from any source, or continues to the next source if the current attempt fails.
10430	Loads properties from a file path specified in system properties using PropertiesHelper, returning null if loading fails.
10431	Loads properties from classpath resource, returning null if unsuccessful.
10432	Method `getPropertiesUsingCWD` attempts to load properties using `PropertiesHelper` from a resource identified by `getPropertiesResourceName()`. If loading fails due to an `IOException`, the exception is caught and ignored, and the method returns `null`.
10433	Removes a functor from its parent context and replaces it with a transformed built-in functor if the functor was actually transformed. The method checks if the functor is in the body of a clause or functor, applies a transformation, and updates the parent structure accordingly.
10434	Returns the final assigned value of this variable by traversing the chain of substitutions until a non-variable term is found.
10435	Sets the substitution term, binding to the storage cell if the term is a variable.
10436	Creates and returns a new PriorityQueue configured with a GreedyComparator for SearchNode objects.
10437	Cleans up resources by closing the ObjectOutputStream (oos) if it exists and setting it to null, then interrupting and setting the connector to null to allow garbage collection.
10438	Appends a logging event to a remote host via socket connection, handling connection management and automatic reconnection if needed.
10439	Starts a new connector thread if one doesn't already exist, setting it as a daemon thread with minimum priority.
10440	Initializes and adds multiple printer objects to the printers list, including SourceClausePrinter, PositionPrinter, UnoptimizedLabelPrinter, UnoptimizedByteCodePrinter, LabelPrinter, and ByteCodePrinter, each configured with incrementing column numbers starting from 0.
10441	Commits all pending changes made within the current transaction by applying them to the resource and releasing the global write lock. If no transaction is active or no changes exist, the method performs no action. Throws an IllegalStateException if interrupted while waiting for the global write lock.
10442	Rolls back all changes made by the current transaction. If the current isolation level is not None, it retrieves the transaction ID from the thread, cancels all pending operations associated with that transaction, and removes all tracked changes for the transaction. If no changes were made or the isolation level is None, this method does nothing.
10443	Requests a write operation to be executed either immediately or cached for later execution depending on the transaction isolation level.
10444	Adds a cached write operation to the transaction writes cache for the specified transaction ID. If no cache exists for the transaction, it creates a new list and stores it.
10445	Acquires a global write lock for the specified transaction, ensuring only one transaction can hold the lock at a time. If the current transaction doesn't already own the lock, it waits until the lock is available. The method uses a write lock to coordinate access and guarantees proper lock release in the finally block.
10446	Releases the global write lock by setting the lock's transaction ID to null and signaling that the lock is free, ensuring proper lock cleanup in a try-finally block.
10447	**Summary:** Attempts to enlist a transactional resource with the current transaction session, throwing an IllegalStateException if no session is present.
10448	This method processes CSS rule sets within media queries by:
1. Extracting scope and selector group nodes from the rule set
2. Handling cases where no selector group exists
3. Processing media query nodes and their nested rule sets
4. Wrapping media query scopes with new rule sets when needed
5. Combining outer selectors with nested selectors using combinators
6. Moving processed nodes back to the parent structure
7. Adding proper spacing and newlines for formatting

The method essentially flattens nested CSS structure by merging selectors from parent rule sets into media query rule sets while maintaining proper CSS syntax and formatting.
10449	Offers the specified element to the queue with a timeout, returning true if successful or false if timed out.
10450	Method: `poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`
Summary: This method retrieves and removes the head element from a queue with a specified timeout. It uses a reentrant lock for thread safety and waits for an element to become available within the given timeout period. If an element is available, it is returned; otherwise, the method returns null after the timeout expires. The method is interruptible and properly handles interrupted exceptions by propagating them after signaling other waiting threads.
10451	Puts an element into the collection, throwing InterruptedException if the operation is interrupted. Internally calls tryPut() and catches SynchException which is intentionally ignored as documented in the method's comment.
10452	Inserts an element into the buffer, signals waiting consumers, and optionally unlocks and blocks the current thread until the element is consumed. Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
10453	Returns the next object from the source, wrapping any RemoteException in an IllegalStateException.
10454	Returns the property value as a boolean, or false if the property is null or cannot be parsed as a boolean.
10455	Returns the property value as an Integer, or null if the property is not found or cannot be converted to Integer.
10456	Returns the property value as a Long object, or null if the property is not found or cannot be converted to Long.
10457	Calls a mixin with the given name and arguments, creating a cloned scope with applied arguments and marking the containing rule set as invisible.
10458	Sets up an addition visitor with custom handling for different node types: parameters (stores definitions and adds children), rule sets (maps selectors to rule sets), scopes (absorbs children), variables (stores definitions by name), and properties (stores latest property by name, with special handling for filter and vendor-specific keywords).
10459	Backtracks through search nodes by undoing operators until a node with unexamined successors is found or the root is reached.
10460	Retrieves bytecode data from a code buffer based on the provided call point information, extracting a specified number of bytes starting from the entry point.
10461	Executes a compiled query and extracts variable bindings from successful resolutions. Returns a set of Variables with their values decoded from heap locations, using a shared variable context across all results. Only collects results when query resolution succeeds.
10462	Decodes a heap term starting at the given address into a Term object, handling different heap tags (REF, STR, CON, LIS) by recursively processing arguments and creating appropriate Term instances (Variable or Functor) based on the tag type.
10463	Captures the state of an object by iterating through its entire inheritance chain, accessing all fields (including private/protected ones), and storing their values in a map organized by class. Fields are only captured if they pass the shouldBeSaved() filter. The method uses reflection to bypass access restrictions and caches field values by field name within class-specific maps.
10464	Restores field values from the cache to the provided object by iterating through the inheritance chain, accessing each field by name, making it accessible, and setting its value. Throws NoSuchFieldException if a field doesn't exist and IllegalStateException if a field cannot be accessed despite being made accessible.
10465	Returns the cached value for a specified class and attribute, or null if the class is not in the cache.
10466	Stores an attribute-value pair in a cache organized by class. If the class doesn't have a cache yet, it creates one. Then stores the attribute and its value in that class's cache.
10467	Returns all field names (as a Collection) for a given class by retrieving them from an internal cache. Returns null if the class is not found in the cache.
10468	Executes test runner commands by generating both Unix and Windows scripts for each command and writing them to the specified production script output directory.
10469	Adds an element to the priority queue with atomic operations, ensuring thread safety by using compare-and-swap mechanisms to update tail references and handle concurrent modifications.
10470	**Summary:**

The `poll()` method removes and returns the head element from a multi-level linked list-based queue. It traverses levels from the top until it finds a non-empty list, then attempts to atomically update the head marker to extract the first data item. If successful, it returns the item after nulling out its reference to prevent memory leaks. If the queue is empty, it returns `null`. The method handles concurrent access by using compare-and-swap operations and skips over deleted or null items during traversal.

10480	Returns a Properties object loaded from the given URL by opening it as an input stream and parsing the properties.
10481	Returns Properties object loaded from a file or URL specified by the given path name. If the path is null, returns null. If the path is a URL, loads properties from that URL; otherwise treats it as a file path and loads properties from that file.
10482	Computes and returns the grid size based on model dimensions and separators. Calculates total width and height by summing separator sizes with converted column and row values.
10483	Initializes font metrics by calculating character width, height, and descent values from the current font, but only if not already initialized.
10484	Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list in a thread-safe manner. Initializes the listener list if it hasn't been created yet, then synchronously adds the new listener to the list.
10485	Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the list of listeners for a specific property. Initializes the listeners list if it doesn't exist yet, then synchronously adds the listener to the list.
10486	Removes a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list for a specific property. If the listener was registered for the specified property, it will be removed from the list. This method is thread-safe as it synchronizes on the listeners collection.
10487	Fires a property change event to all registered listeners by dispatching the event to the Swing event queue for each listener.
10488	Creates a new DoubleRangeType instance with the specified name and range limits, ensuring min is not greater than max. If a type with the same name already exists, it validates that the existing type has identical parameters; if so, returns the existing type, otherwise throws an exception. Uses thread synchronization to safely manage concurrent access to the types map.
10489	Method: doFade
Summary: Initiates or updates a color fade animation for a specified group. Creates a new fade state with timer and color interpolator if the group doesn't exist, otherwise replaces the existing fade with new target and interpolator. Sets up the initial color and starts the fade timer with a 400ms delay.
10490	Adds a horizontal bar (grip panel) to the desktop application's status bar area using the specified layout and console height resizer.
10491	Shows the left vertical bar by creating a grip panel with the left pane width resizer and adding it to the frame's content pane at the LEFT_VERTICAL_BAR position.
10492	Shows the right vertical bar by creating a grip panel with the right pane width resizer and adding it to the frame's content pane at the RIGHT_VERTICAL_BAR position.
10493	Sanitizes radio controls in a form by ensuring only one radio button per group can be checked. For each radio button that is currently checked, if another radio button with the same name already exists in the form, it removes the 'checked' attribute from the previously found radio button. This prevents multiple radio buttons with the same name from being simultaneously checked.
10494	Waits until all conditions are met or thread is interrupted, using a monitor to synchronize and evaluate wait times in a loop until conditions pass.
10495	Waits for the specified condition to be met, with a timeout. Returns true if all conditions are satisfied before timeout, false otherwise. Uses a monitor for synchronization and evaluates conditions repeatedly until either all conditions pass, the timeout expires, or the thread is interrupted. The method calculates wait times based on condition evaluation and respects the provided timeout using nanosecond precision.
10496	Executes test runner commands by generating both Unix and Windows scripts for each command in the commands map, writing them to the specified script output directory.
10497	Appends classpath elements to a command line string, using appropriate path separators and classpath separators based on the operating system (Unix-like vs Windows).
10498	Creates a new DateRangeType instance with the specified name and date range, ensuring the from date is not after the to date. If a type with the same name already exists, it validates that the definitions match exactly - if they do, the existing type is returned; if they don't match, an exception is thrown. The method is thread-safe and maintains a global map of all created types.
10499	Prints the introduction banner for LoJiX Prolog including copyright information and license details.
10500	Initializes and configures a ConsoleReader instance with bell disabled.
10501	Evaluates a sentence by handling query clauses differently from program clauses. For query clauses, it ends the current scope, compiles the sentence, and evaluates the query. For program clauses, it checks if the clause belongs to a new predicate and ends the scope if necessary, then adds the program clause to the engine.
10502	Evaluates and displays query solutions from a logic engine, printing true/false for empty solutions or variable bindings for non-empty solutions, with interactive prompting for additional solutions.
10503	Returns a MultiTypeData object representing the boolean value, with its native type set to BOOLEAN.

10510	Returns a MultiTypeData object containing the types that the double value can be converted to, with the native type set to DOUBLE.
10511	Converts a String to a MultiTypeData object, determining the most specific data type that the string can represent. The method checks if the string can be parsed as boolean, int, byte, char, short, long, float, or double, and sets appropriate type flags. It defaults to String type and updates flags for all successfully parsed numeric types. The method handles NumberFormatException exceptions gracefully by clearing the corresponding type flags when parsing fails.
10512	Returns a MultiTypeData object containing all possible types that the string representation of the given object can be converted to, with the native type set to OBJECT.
10513	Converts a MultiTypeData object to the specified class type if possible, throwing ClassCastException if conversion is not supported.
10514	Sets an attribute with the specified name and value in the page context using the current scope.
10515	Clears data elements up to a specified key, adjusting the start marker to point to the first non-null element after the cleared range. If the key is within the current range, only clears up to that key; otherwise, clears the entire range.
10516	Expands the internal array size when needed, setting new size to either 1.5 times current size or space required for a new key, whichever is larger. Copies existing data from old array to new array, handling wraparound case where data wraps from end to beginning of array. Updates offset and length to reflect new array size.
10517	Inserts a character into the data grid at the specified column and row positions, updating the maximum column and row counters if necessary.

10523	Pads a string on the right side with characters from a padding string until the desired size is reached. If the padding string is empty, returns the original string. Uses a CharacterIterator to cycle through the padding characters repeatedly until the string reaches the specified size.
10524	Returns all parsing errors concatenated together as a string, or empty string if no errors exist.
10525	Returns a string representation of all properties in the parsedProperties collection, formatted as "key = value" pairs under the header "Options in force:". Returns an empty string if parsedProperties is null.
10526	Method: getUsage()
Summary: Generates a formatted usage string displaying all command line options with aligned option names, arguments, and comments.

10531	Checks if a command line option's argument matches its required format pattern. If the argument doesn't match the expected format, adds an error message to the parsing errors list.
10532	Compares elements from two iterators using a mapping function and returns error messages for mismatches.
10533	Returns an Enumeration of command-line options for configuring the stemmer algorithm, named entities file, stopwords file, and cache size. Options include:
- Stemmer type selection with multiple algorithm choices
- Named entities file specification (optional)
- Stopwords file specification (optional)
- Cache size configuration (default 1000)
10534	Returns an array of command-line options for the stemmer configuration, including stemmer type, named entities handling, stopwords processing, and caching settings.
10535	Sets the stemmer type if the provided value has valid stemmer tags, then invalidates the component to trigger a redraw.
10536	Returns the actual stemmer instance, creating it if necessary. Initializes the stemmer with the specified algorithm (Orengo, Porter, or Savoy), configures it with named entities and stopwords from files, and sets up caching based on the cache size. Throws PTStemmerException if stemmer creation fails.
10537	Returns the stemmed version of a given word using the actual stemmer, or null if stemming fails.
10538	The main method initializes a Portuguese stemmer by calling `Stemming.useStemmer()` with a `PTStemmer` instance and the provided command-line arguments. Any exceptions thrown during this process are caught and their stack traces are printed to the console.
10539	Creates a FloatRangeType instance with the specified name and range bounds, ensuring min <= max. Throws IllegalArgumentException if min > max or if a type with the same name already exists with different bounds. Returns the existing type if an identical one already exists, otherwise adds and returns the new type. Uses synchronization to ensure thread-safe operations on the FLOAT_RANGE_TYPES map.
10540	Resets the machine state by reinitializing all internal structures including data heap, code buffer, stack pointers, registers, trail, and unification stack. Clears all execution state, resets instruction pointer, and notifies any debug monitor of the reset event.
10541	Returns a string representation of the environment frame containing ep, cp, and n values from the data array.
10542	Returns a string representation of the choice frame data at the current breakpoint position, including n, ep, cp, bp, l, trp, hp, and b0 values from the data array. Returns empty string if breakpoint is 0.
10543	Calls internal methods based on function ID: CALL_1_ID invokes internalCall_1(), EXECUTE_1_ID invokes internalExecute_1(), otherwise throws IllegalStateException.
10544	Returns the next stack frame address based on the relationship between execution pointer (ep) and base pointer (bp):
- If ep equals bp, returns STACK_BASE
- If ep > bp, returns ep + STACK[ep + 2] + 3  
- If ep < bp, returns bp + STACK[bp] + 8
10545	Method `backtrack` performs a stack backtracking operation by:
1. Checking if the base pointer equals zero (bottom of stack)
2. If at bottom, returns true to indicate failure/exit
3. Otherwise, retrieves values from stack positions based on current base pointer and stack contents
4. Sets `b0` to value at position `bp + data.get(bp) + 7`
5. Sets `ip` to value at position `bp + data.get(bp) + 4`
6. Returns false to continue execution

The method appears to be part of a stack-based virtual machine or interpreter implementation.
10546	Method `trail` conditionally adds an address to a trail data structure. It checks if the address falls within a specific range defined by `hbp`, `hp`, and `bp` constants. If the address satisfies the range condition ((addr < hbp) OR (hp < addr < bp)), it stores the address in the `data` array at index `trp` and increments the `trp` pointer. This appears to be part of a backtracking or search algorithm implementation where addresses are tracked during traversal.
10547	Unwinds a trail by updating data references from a start address to an end address, where each data element at position i is updated to reference its own address.
10548	Method `tidyTrail()` cleans up the trail by removing invalid choice points. It determines the target position to tidy down to (either root of trail or current choice point), then iterates through the trail from that position. For each entry, if the address is invalid (outside valid ranges), it increments the position. Otherwise, it removes the entry by replacing it with the last entry and decrementing the trail pointer. This effectively eliminates stale choice points from the trail structure.

**Key operations:**
- Determines tidy target position based on current choice point
- Removes invalid entries from trail
- Maintains trail integrity by compacting valid entries

**Parameters:** None
**Returns:** Nothing
10549	Unifies two terms in a Prolog-like system by comparing their structures and binding variables accordingly. The method uses a stack-based approach to traverse and compare terms, handling different term types (references, structures, compounds, and lists) while managing variable bindings. Returns true if unification succeeds, false otherwise.
10550	Unifies a constant value with the content at a given address in the store. Returns true if unification succeeds, false otherwise. Handles three cases: if the address contains a reference, it binds it to a constant cell; if it contains a constant, it checks for equality; otherwise, it fails.
10551	Returns a string representation of a slot address based on mode and xi values. For STACK_ADDR mode, returns "Y" + (xi - ep - 3), otherwise returns "X" + xi.
10552	Returns a randomly generated solvable 8-puzzle state by shuffling the goal state until a valid solution is found.
10553	This method determines if an 8-puzzle state is solvable by counting the number of illegal swaps needed to arrange tiles in the correct position. It creates a copy of the input state to avoid modifying the original, then compares it against the goal state. For each position, it swaps the correct tile into place while counting illegal moves. An 8-puzzle is solvable if and only if the total number of illegal swaps is even. The method returns true if the puzzle is solvable, false otherwise.
10554	Returns a new puzzle state that is the result of applying the given operator to this state. Creates a deep copy of the current state and applies the operator in-place to generate the child state.
10555	Returns an iterator over valid operators for moving the empty space in a 3x3 puzzle grid. Valid moves are determined by the current position of the empty space (emptyX, emptyY), allowing movement Up, Down, Left, or Right only when the empty space is not at the respective boundaries. The method checks all four directions and returns an iterator containing all valid moves as OperatorImpl objects with names "U", "D", "L", or "R".
10556	Returns a pretty-printed string representation of the board by concatenating each row, replacing empty spaces ('E') with actual spaces, and adding newlines between rows.
10557	Moves a tile to a specified location by swapping adjacent tiles, counting and returning the number of illegal swaps performed during the process.
10558	Swaps two tiles on the board at given coordinates and updates the empty tile position if either swapped tile was empty. Returns true if no empty tile was involved in the swap, false otherwise.
10559	Converts a 9-character string into a list of characters by first creating a character array and then adding each character to an ArrayList.
10560	Converts a list of characters into an 8-puzzle state by populating the board and tracking the empty tile position.
10561	Converts a LogRecord message to a log4j-compatible format by applying parameter substitution using MessageFormat when placeholders like {0}, {1}, etc. are present in the message template.
10562	Converts a logging level from one framework to Log4j equivalent levels, mapping SEVERE to ERROR, WARNING to WARN, INFO to INFO, FINE to DEBUG, FINER to TRACE, OFF to OFF, and defaulting to OFF for any unrecognized levels.
10563	Adds an element to the requeue collection and maintains a mapping from the element to its wrapper record.
10564	Adds an element to the requeue list with specified owner and acquisition state, returning a wrapper object for the queued element.
10565	Updates the count for atomically counted queues and size for sizeable elements/queues when a record is added.
10566	Decrements the size and count of the queue, updating atomic counters and size thresholds when appropriate.
10567	Method signals listeners when size crosses water mark thresholds. Specifically, it calls `signalAll()` when size crosses below low water mark threshold and `signal()` when size crosses below high water mark threshold.
10568	Returns a naming enumeration of the names bound in the specified context. If the name is empty, returns all bindings in this context. If the name refers to a context, returns the listing of that context. Throws NotContextException if the name does not refer to a context.
10569	Lists the bindings contained in the specified context. If the name is empty, returns all bindings in this context. If the name refers to a context, returns the bindings of that context. Throws NotContextException if the name does not refer to a context.
10570	Adds a property to the environment hashtable, creating it if necessary, and returns the previous value associated with the property name.
10571	Removes a property from the environment map and returns its previous value. Returns null if the environment is null or the property doesn't exist.
10572	Runs garbage collection repeatedly until memory usage stabilizes or reaches 500 iterations, by comparing consecutive memory usage measurements and triggering finalization and GC cycles.
10573	Rule Literal() returns a sequence containing either Color(), MultiDimension(), Dimension(), or String() followed by pushing a new SimpleNode created from the match result onto the stack.
10574	Resolves a mixin reference by looking up the rule set in the current scope stack and calling it as a mixin. Returns true if successful, throws UndefinedMixinException if the mixin is not found.
10575	Pushes a variable reference node onto the stack, checking if the variable is defined in available scopes. If the variable is not found, throws an UndefinedVariableException.
10576	Sets the maximum height for a specific row, only updating if the new height is greater than the current maximum height for that row.
10577	Updates the maximum width for a given column, replacing the previous value only if the new width is greater.
10578	This method handles pagination logic by retrieving form data from the request, updating a paged list object stored in the session with the current page number and index offset, then returning a success forward mapping. It extracts pagination parameters from a DynaActionForm and updates the corresponding PagedList object's state before forwarding to the success view.
10579	Creates a new heuristic search node from a successor, attaches the heuristic evaluator, and computes the heuristic cost h for the node.
10580	Executes the action with error handling, catching exceptions and forwarding to error page defined in web.xml, while logging warnings and rethrowing as ServletException.
10581	Substitutes built-in predicates in a clause by walking through it with a positional walker and applying built-in transformation visitor.

10584	Converts a list structure to string representation, recursively processing cons cells and formatting output with brackets and commas.
10585	Evaluates whether the first numeric value is less than the second numeric value, using appropriate arithmetic precision based on whether the operands are integers or real numbers. Returns true if firstNumber < secondNumber, false otherwise.
10586	Method `running()` transitions the object's state from `Initial` to `Running` using a write lock for thread safety, and signals all waiting threads about the state change.
10587	The `terminating` method safely transitions the object's state from "Running" to "Shutdown" in a thread-safe manner. It acquires a write lock, checks if the current state is "Running", and if so, updates the state to "Shutdown" and signals all waiting threads. The write lock is always released in the finally block to ensure proper cleanup regardless of exceptions.
10588	Method `terminated()` transitions the object's state to `Terminated` if the current state is either `Shutdown` or `Running`, and then signals all waiting threads. The method uses a write lock for thread safety.
10589	Adds a new element to the circular doubly linked list heap structure, maintaining the minimum element reference and updating the heap size.
10590	This method calculates the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of a positive integer n. It uses a binary search-like approach to find the smallest integer k such that 2^k ≥ n. The algorithm works by examining bits from the most significant position downward, building up the result bit by bit. If n is already a power of 2, it returns the exact logarithm; otherwise, it returns the next higher integer (ceiling). For example, ceilingLog2(1) returns 0, ceilingLog2(2) returns 1, ceilingLog2(3) returns 2, ceilingLog2(4) returns 2, etc.
10591	Updates the minimum node by comparing the given node with the current minimum using either a custom comparator or natural ordering.
10592	Method compares two Node objects by either using a predefined comparator or falling back to natural ordering through Comparable interface.
10593	Method inserts a new node into a circular doubly-linked list by breaking and reattaching node chains in the root list.

10595	Returns a Set containing all elements found by the specified SearchMethod.
10596	Creates and returns a Collection containing all elements found by the specified SearchMethod.
10597	Finds all solutions using the provided search method and adds them to the result collection.
10598	Returns the next non-null element in the sequence by applying a mapping function to elements from the source iterator until a non-null result is found or the iterator is exhausted.
10599	Restores property values from a map to an object by invoking appropriate setter methods. For each property name and value in the input map, it determines the correct parameter type (handling multi-type data conversion), finds the matching setter method on the target object, and invokes it with the restored value. Null values and multi-type data objects are handled specially, with multi-type data being converted to the best matching type among available setters. If no matching setter method exists, the method silently continues without throwing an exception.
10600	Returns the value of a specified property from the memento cache. Throws NoSuchFieldException if the property doesn't exist.
10601	Stores multi-typed data under the specified property name in the values map.
10602	Stores the specified value under the given property name in the values collection.
10603	Captures property values from an object's getter methods into a map, optionally ignoring null values. Iterates through all public methods of the object's class, identifies getter methods (methods starting with "get", taking no parameters, and returning a value), calls each getter method using reflection, and stores the returned values in a map with property names derived from the method names. Throws IllegalStateException if reflection operations fail.

10877	Returns a collection view of the values contained in this map. The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. The collection supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from this map, via the Iterator.remove, Collection.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support add or addAll operations.
10878	Returns a FilterableSet containing all entries in the map. The returned set provides iteration over all entries but does not support contains() or remove() operations due to potential duplicates during deletion processes. The set's size reflects the current map size and clear() operation affects the underlying map.
10879	Copies all entries from this transactional map to another transactional map, handling different transaction statuses (added, deleted, or no change) and maintaining proper transaction state through attach/detach operations. In auto-commit mode, it simply copies all entries without transaction handling.
10880	Removes expired cache entries based on maximum lifetime threshold by iterating through the age list from newest to oldest entries and deleting those that exceed the expiration time.
