14744	Returns a full path to a notebook given its name.
14745	Get notebook representation by ID.
14746	Get the NotebookNode representation of a notebook by notebook_id.
Model explanation:

  * The function `get_notebook_object` takes a `notebook_id` as an input parameter and returns the `NotebookNode` representation of the notebook.
  * The function first finds the path of the notebook using the `find_path` method.
  * Then, it checks whether the path is a file using the `os.path.isfile` method. If it is not a file, it raises a `web.HTTPError` with a message indicating that the notebook does not exist.
  * If the path is a file, it retrieves the last modified time of the file using the `os.stat` method and converts it to a UTC datetime object using `datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp`.
  * Next, it opens the file in read mode using `open` and reads its contents into the variable `s`.
  * The function then attempts to read the contents of the file as JSON using the `current.reads` method. If it is successful, the `NotebookNode` object `nb` is created.
  * If the file is unreadable, it raises a `web.HTTPError` with a message indicating that the notebook is unreadable.
  * Finally, the function sets the `name` attribute of the `metadata` of the `nb` object to the filename of the notebook using `os.path.splitext` and `os.path.basename`.
  * The function returns a tuple containing the `last_modified` time and the `nb` object.
