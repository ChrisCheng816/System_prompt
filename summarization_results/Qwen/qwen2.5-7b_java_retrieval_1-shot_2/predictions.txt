10926	Responds to a challenge with a Base64-encoded authentication response.
10927	Convert this object to JSON and return the ByteArrayOutputStream
10928	Processes events and handles their output sequentially. Waits for an event from a queue, generates output extensions, handles them with timeouts, and notifies when done.
10929	Dispatches events to appropriate handlers while respecting event time-to-live constraints.
10930	Wait until all queue dispatchers finish.
