14850	This function configures an IPython shell object for matplotlib use by setting up the appropriate backend and registering necessary post-execution functions for displaying figures.
14851	Activates pylab mode, importing numpy, matplotlib, and related packages into the user's namespace for interactive use.
14852	The `_trace` method is a trace function used with `sys.settrace` to collect code execution data in a profiler by tracing events like 'call', 'line', 'return', and 'exception', and storing the program flow and line numbers in a data structure.
14853	This method starts a Tracer by setting the current thread and returning a Python function suitable for use with `sys.settrace()`.
14854	Stops the tracer by setting the stopped flag and unhooking the trace function if called on the correct thread.
14855	Starts a new Tracer object, configures it with various attributes from the current instance, starts it, and appends it to `self.tracers`, returning the result of the start function.
14856	The method `_installation_trace` is called on new threads to install the real tracer, removes itself as the current trace function, invokes the real tracer function with the current event, and returns the new trace function to continue tracing.
14857	Starts collecting trace information by pausing any existing collectors, adding itself to the collectors list, checking for any existing fullcoverage tracers, and installing a new tracer on the current thread and for other threads using threading.settrace.
14858	Stops collecting trace information by pausing the current collector, clearing the tracers, and resuming the previous collector in the stack if it exists.

14869	This method logs a warning message to the standard error stream and appends it to a list of warnings.
14870	This method updates a `source_match` matcher with the latest imported packages by checking if the packages in the `source_pkgs` attribute have been imported. If a package has been imported, its file is added to the `source_match` matcher and removed from `source_pkgs`. The method also checks if the file exists and if it's a package (not a module), and if so, it updates the file path accordingly.
14871	The `start` method initializes code coverage measurement by setting up matchers for source files and directories, and preparing to save coverage data if necessary.
14872	The method `_atexit` is a cleanup function that stops the service if it's running and saves any in-memory data if automatic saving is enabled.
14873	The `exclude` method adds a regular expression to a specified list (`exclude` or `partial`) in the `config` object of the class, and then calls a method to mark the configuration as stale.
14874	It returns a compiled regex for the given exclusion list.
14875	The method `save` saves collected coverage data to a file with a unique suffix, incorporating the hostname, test name, process ID, and a random number for distinction.
14876	The method `combine` in this code reads multiple coverage data files,combines them together into the current measurements, and handles file name aliases based on the configuration.
14877	This method collects and processes data, adding line and arc data, resetting the collector, warning about unimported source packages, checking for collected data, and marking unexecuted files.
14878	This method takes a parameter `morf` and returns the output of `self.analysis2(morf)` excluding the second element.
14879	The method `analysis2` analyzes a module or a filename by determining its coverage statistics, returning a 5-tuple with the filename, executable lines, excluded lines, missing lines, and a formatted string of missing lines.
14880	Analyze a single morf or code unit, returning an `Analysis` object after harvesting data and ensuring the input is a `CodeUnit` object.
14881	Generates a summary report of coverage for each module in `morfs`, displaying percentages of statements executed, missing, and listing lines missed, with options to include/exclude specific modules based on filename patterns and handling errors.
14882	The `annotate` method is used to annotate a list of modules, writing the annotated source code to a new file with a ",cover" suffix, and prefixing each line with a marker indicating coverage status.
14883	Generates an HTML report with optional customization options such as CSS files and report titles, and returns the total percentage covered.
14884	This method generates an XML coverage report based on the provided parameters and coverage data, returning the total percentage covered.

14887	The `display_svg` function displays the SVG representation of one or more Python objects or raw SVG data depending on the value of the `raw` keyword argument.
14888	The `display_png` function displays the PNG representation of Python objects or raw PNG data based on the `raw` parameter.
14889	displays the JPEG representation of the provided objects
14890	The `display_latex` function displays the LaTeX representation of given Python objects or raw LaTeX data.
14891	The `display_json` function takes one or more Python objects or raw JSON data and displays their JSON representation using a frontend that supports JSON display. If the `raw` parameter is set to `True`, it passes the raw data to a function called `publish_json`. Otherwise, it passes the data to a function called `display` with the `include` parameter set to `['text/plain','application/json']`.
14892	The method `display_javascript` is used to display the Javascript representation of one or more Python objects. If the `raw` parameter is set to True, it will display the raw Javascript data; otherwise, it will display the Python objects formatted as Javascript.
14893	The `reload` method reloads the raw data from either a file or a URL, handling file I/O and optional content type encoding if the data is retrieved from a URL.
14894	Finds the full path to a command using the `which` command and returns it as a string.
14895	The method `system` executes a command in a subshell and returns the child process's exit status.
14896	This method sets up a socket pair using ZeroMQ, connects one end to a file descriptor (fd) for reading, and returns the other end of the socket pair for reading events using select.
14897	The method `run` reads lines from a file descriptor `self.fd`, sends each line over a socket `self.sock`, and closes both the file and the socket when done.
