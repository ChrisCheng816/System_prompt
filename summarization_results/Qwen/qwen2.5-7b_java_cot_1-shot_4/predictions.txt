### Created Question:
The following are a few example(s) with thought steps for code summarization.
### Example 1:
 Input:
public static boolean check(String passwd, String hashed) {
        try {
            String[] parts = hashed.split("\\$");

            if (parts.length != 5 || !parts[1].equals("s0")) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid hashed value");
            }

            long params = Long.parseLong(parts[2], 16);
            byte[] salt = decode(parts[3].toCharArray());
            byte[] derived0 = decode(parts[4].toCharArray());

            int N = (int) Math.pow(2, params >> 16 & 0xffff);
            int r = (int) params >> 8 & 0xff;
            int p = (int) params      & 0xff;

            byte[] derived1 = SCrypt.scrypt(passwd.getBytes("UTF-8"), salt, N, r, p, 32);

            if (derived0.length != derived1.length) return false;

            int result = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < derived0.length; i++) {
                result |= derived0[i] ^ derived1[i];
            }
            return result == 0;
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("JVM doesn't support UTF-8?");
        } catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("JVM doesn't support SHA1PRNG or HMAC_SHA256?");
        }
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'check' and takes two parameters: a String 'passwd' and a String 'hashed'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true or false depending on some condition.
# Step 3: The body of the function parses the hashed string, extracts scrypt parameters and salt, and recomputes the derived key.
# Step 4: It compares the recomputed key with the original using a constant-time check.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to verify password correctness based on scrypt hashing.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final
