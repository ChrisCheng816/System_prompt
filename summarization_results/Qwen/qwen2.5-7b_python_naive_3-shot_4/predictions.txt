Explanation: The provided code defines a function called `get_unique_key_from_get`. It retrieves the current site's domain using Django's Site.objects.get_current() and then encodes a dictionary called `get_dict` into a URL using the function `get_dict_to_encoded_url`. After that, it concatenates the site's domain with the encoded URL to form a cache key. Finally, it returns the MD5 hash of the cache key, which serves as a unique identifier for the GET data.
14916	Returns domain name portion of a URL.
14917	Returns a dictionary from a URL params.
