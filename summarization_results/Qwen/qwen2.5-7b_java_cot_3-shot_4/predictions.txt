**Created Question**:
Compose a summary for the following method.

**Created Input**:
```java
public int findIndex(int[] arr, int key) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] == key) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1; // Key not found
}
```

**Created Thought Steps**:
# Step 1: The function is named 'findIndex' and takes an array of integers 'arr' and a single integer 'key' as parameters.
# Step 2: The return type is 'int', so the function returns an integer value.
# Step 3: The function iterates over each element in the array 'arr'.
# Step 4: If a match is found where an element equals 'key', the index of that element is returned.
# Step 5: If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, -1 is returned to indicate that 'key' is not present in 'arr'.
# Step 6: The function's purpose is to find the index of a given key in an array.
# Step 8: The final summary will be a brief and concise sentence.

To respond the question, I reflected on the method's purpose and its components. The method `setStyles` takes three parameters: a `featureTable`, a `featureId`, and a `Styles` object. It first deletes existing styles for the specified feature. If the `Styles` object is not null, it sets a default style and loops through a map of geometric styles to set each one. The method's overall purpose is to update the styles for a specific feature, implying that it manages or applies visual representations or attributes to geographical data or similar elements in a database or similar storage system.
