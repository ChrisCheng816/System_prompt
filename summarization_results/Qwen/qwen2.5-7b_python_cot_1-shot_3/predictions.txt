        Arguments:
            product_id (int): The ID of the product
            quantity (int): The quantity to add to the inventory
        """

                product.quantity += quantity
                session.commit()
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'update_inventory' and takes 'self', 'product_id', and 'quantity' as parameters.
# Step 2: It updates the inventory quantity for a given product.
# Step 3: The function uses a database session to interact with the database.
# Step 4: It queries the database for the product with the given ID.
# Step 5: If the product is found, it updates the quantity by adding the specified quantity.
# Step 6: The session is committed to save the changes.
# Step 7: The final summary will be a concise sentence describing the function's purpose.

- `command` is the Bash command to execute.
- `nindent` specifies the indentation level for formatting.
- `mdir` is the module directory which helps in resolving the path to the command.
- `fpointer` is the function pointer where the output will be directed. It defaults to `cog.out` but can be any function.
- The `term_echo` function is used to format and output the command's STDOUT in reStructuredText.

### Detailed thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'off_splits' and is defined as a method of a class that takes 'self' and 'year' as parameters.
# Step 2: It returns a Pandas DataFrame.
# Step 3: The function retrieves a document containing split data for the specified year.
# Step 4: It extracts tables from the document and parses them into DataFrames.
# Step 5: These DataFrames are modified by adding a 'split' column and renaming the original column to 'split_value'.
# Step 6: If no DataFrames are created, an empty DataFrame is returned.
# Step 7: Finally, the DataFrames are concatenated and returned with a reset index.

### Explanation:

### Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'frombytes' and is defined to create a new ImageDriver of type 'MEM'.
# Step 2: It accepts three parameters: 'data', 'size', and 'bandtype'.
# Step 3: 'data' is expected to be a byte buffer of raw pixel data.
# Step 4: 'size' is expected to be a tuple representing the dimensions and number of bands.
# Step 5: 'bandtype' is an optional parameter specifying the band data type, with a default value.
# Step 6: The function creates an in-memory raster using the provided parameters.
# Step 7: The raster is then initialized from the byte buffer using the 'frombytes' method.
# Step 8: The function returns the initialized in-memory raster.

### Explanation:
# Step 1: The function is named 'disambiguate_dns_url' and is defined as a method of a class (it takes 'self' as its first parameter).
# Step 2: It accepts two parameters: 'url' (required) and 'location' (required).
# Step 3: The docstring explains the purpose and arguments of the function.
# Step 4: It checks if 'location' is a valid IP address using 'ip_pat.match'.
# Step 5: If not, it converts 'location' to an IP address using 'socket.gethostbyname'.
# Step 6: Finally, it calls another function 'disambiguate_url' with the modified 'location' and returns its result.
# Step 7: The summary will be a concise sentence describing the function's behavior.
