2807	Get all registered interceptor descriptions for a class.
This method combines interceptor descriptions from class-level, method-level, and optionally default interceptors into a single, unmodifiable set.
The first time it is called, it initializes the `allInterceptors` set by adding descriptions from `classInterceptors`. If `excludeDefaultInterceptors` is false, it also adds descriptions from `defaultInterceptors`. Then, it iterates over `methodInterceptors`, adding descriptions from each list to the `allInterceptors` set. If `allInterceptors` is already initialized, the method returns the existing set without making additional changes.
This approach ensures that all interceptor descriptions are available in a single, centralized location, making it easier to manage and retrieve interceptor information.

Summary:
The method `match` checks if an `InvDataset` meets the conditions specified by the filter it belongs to.

It then sets a default target for matching patterns if none is specified, typically based on the dataset type (e.g., "name" for collections or "urlPath" for atomic datasets). The method uses regular expressions to match dataset properties against the filter's patterns. If a match is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The method handles both regular expression matching and can produce a warning for unsupported filter types.
