### Explanation:
- **Input**: Code for a method named `visit_section` that takes a `layout` parameter and is used to display a section as text.
- **Output**: A 15-token summary of the code in a natural language format.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `visit_section`: The method being described.
  - `layout`: The parameter passed to the method, likely representing the layout of the section.
  - `display`: The main action of the method, which is to display a section as text.
  - `self.section`: A counter that helps manage the nesting level of sections.
  - `self.writeln()`: Inserts a newline character in the output.
  - `self.format_children(layout)`: Handles the formatting of child elements within the section.
- **Summary**: The method increments the section counter, inserts a newline, formats the children of the given layout, decrements the section counter, and inserts another newline to display a section as text.
