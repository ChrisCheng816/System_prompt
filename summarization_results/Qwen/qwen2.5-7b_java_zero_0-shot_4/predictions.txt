5549	This method attempts to create a `SimpleUnit` instance using the `factoryWithExceptions` method and returns it, or `null` if an exception occurs and `debugParse` is `true`.

**Explanation**:
The method `factory` is a static public method that takes a `String` `name` as input. It tries to create a `SimpleUnit` instance by calling another method `factoryWithExceptions(name)`. If this call does not throw any exceptions, the method returns the created `SimpleUnit` instance. However, if anexception occurs during the call to `factoryWithExceptions`, the method catches the exception. If `debugParse` is `true`, it prints a debug message indicating the issue. Regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not, the method returns `null`.
5550	The method `factoryWithExceptions` creates and returns a `SimpleUnit` based on the given name, parsing it with a `UnitFormat` and checking if it represents a time unit, in which case it returns a `TimeUnit` instead. If the unit is not a time unit, it returns a `SimpleUnit`.

**Explanation**:
- The `containsValue` method is overridden from a superclass.
- It takes an `Object` parameter `value`, which is the value to be checked.
- The method first calls `checkValue(value)` to perform some validation on the input value.
- It then calls `lookupValid(value, VALUE, getCurrentThreadId())`, which presumably searches for the value in the data structure based on the current thread ID.
- If the value is found, `lookupValid` returns a non-null object, and the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
- `VALUE` is likely a constant used to indicate the type of lookup being performed.
