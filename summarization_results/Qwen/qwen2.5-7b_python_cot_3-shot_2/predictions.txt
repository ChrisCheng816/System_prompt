### Example 1:
Input:
```python
def update_state(state, action):
    """Update the state based on the provided action.

    This function takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.

    Args:
        state (dict): The current state of the system.
        action (dict): The action to be taken.

    Returns:
        dict: The updated state of the system.
    """
    new_state = state.copy()
    new_state['value'] += action['change']
    return new_state
```
Thought steps:
1. The function is named `update_state`, which is a crucial operation in state-based systems like reinforcement learning.
2. It takes two parameters: `state`, which is a dictionary representing the current state, and `action`, which is another dictionary representing an action to be performed.
3. The function starts by copying the current state into a new variable `new_state` to avoid modifying the original state.
4. It then updates the `value` key in the `new_state` dictionary by adding the value associated with the `change` key in the `action` dictionary.
5. Finally, it returns the `new_state`, which is the updated state after applying the action.

Output:
Update the state based on the provided action.

### Thought Steps:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `_equal_values` determines if two values are considered equal by a parameter.
2. **Context**: This is crucial for operations like merging trajectories and deleting duplicate parameter points.
3. **Equality Check**:
   - Compares if both values are supported by the parameter using `f_supports`.
   - Raises a `TypeError` if both values are unsupported.
   - Ensures both values are of the same type using `_values_of_same_type`.
   - Uses `comparisons.nested_equal` to check equality.
4. **Equality Criteria**:
   - By default, uses `comparisons.nested_equal` to compare values.
   - Subclasses might override this method to implement a different equality comparison.
5. **Summary**: Checks equality of two values according to the parameter's rules, ensuring type consistency and nested comparison.
