        stmt.execute(getDDLStatements());
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Error updating DDL", e);
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'updateDDL' and does not take any parameters.
# Step 2: The return type is void, so the function does not return anything.
# Step 3: The function establishes a database connection using DriverManager getConnection method.
# Step 4: It creates a Statement object to execute DDL statements.
# Step 5: The DDL statements are obtained using getDDLStatements method and executed.
# Step 6: If any SQLException occurs during execution, it throws a RuntimeException with an error message.
# Step 7: The purpose of the function is to update the database schema using DDL statements.
# Step 8: Since the function does not include parameters or a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags are not necessary.
# Step 9: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence.

Output:
Update the database schema using DDL statements.

### Example 3:
Input:

        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Error starting server", e);
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'startServer' and takes one parameter: an int 'port'.
# Step 2: The return type is void, so the function does not return anything.
# Step 3: The function creates a ServerSocket on the specified port.
# Step 4: It enters an infinite loop to accept incoming client connections using serverSocket.accept() method.
# Step 5: For each client connection, it calls the handleClient method to process the request.
# Step 6: If any IOException occurs during server setup or client handling, it throws a RuntimeException with an error message.
# Step 7: The purpose of the function is to start a server that listens for incoming client connections and handles them.
# Step 8: Since the function includes the port parameter but does

### Explanation:
The function `addJarsToJob` is used to add JAR files to the Hadoop job configuration. It takes a `Configuration` object, a boolean flag `allowMultiple`, and a variable number of `jarPatterns` as input. It first checks if the class loader is an instance of `URLClassLoader`. If not, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. If the class loader is `URLClassLoader`, it casts it to `URLClassLoader` and then calls another method to add the JAR URLs specified by the `jarPatterns` to the job configuration. This ensures that the JAR files are available to the Hadoop job, either once or multiple times depending on the `allowMultiple` flag.

public void updateProductDetails(Product product) {
    String query = "UPDATE products SET name = ?, price = ?, quantity = ? WHERE id = ?";
    PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
    pstmt.setString(1, product.getName());
    pstmt.setDouble(2, product.getPrice());
    pstmt.setInt(3, product.getQuantity());
    pstmt.setInt(4, product.getId());
    pstmt.executeUpdate();
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'updateProductDetails' and takes a single parameter: a Product object.
# Step 2: The return type is void, so the function does not return any value.
# Step 3: The body of the function constructs an SQL query string and prepares it using PreparedStatement.
# Step 4: It sets the parameters of the PreparedStatement with the values from the Product object.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to update the details of a product in the database.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:
Update details of a product in the database.

# Step 1: The function 'applyNamespace' takes a 'Namespace' object as a parameter.
# Step 2: It retrieves or creates metadata for the namespace and logs it.
# Step 3: It checks if the namespace already exists.
# Step 4: If it doesn't exist, it attempts to create the namespace and logs the creation.
# Step 5: The function returns true if the namespace was successfully created, otherwise false.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a boolean return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to document the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.

### Example 2:
 Input:
public void addVertex(Polygon polygon, float x, float y) {
    vertices.add(new Vertex(x, y));
    polygon.setVertices(vertices.toArray(new Vertex[0]));
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'addVertex' and takes three parameters: a Polygon object 'polygon', and two float values 'x' and 'y'.
# Step 2: The return type is void, so the function doesn't have a return value.
# Step 3: The body of the function adds a new Vertex to the 'vertices' list of the polygon and updates the polygon's vertices.
# Step 4: The function's purpose is to add a vertex to a polygon and update its vertices.
# Step 5: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 6: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:
Add a vertex to a polygon and update its vertices.

### Example 3:
 Input:
public static void playSound(byte[] soundData) {
    AudioSystem.getClip().open(new AudioInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(soundData)));
    AudioSystem.getClip().start();
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'playSound' and takes one parameter: a byte array 'soundData'.
# Step 2: The return type is void, so the function doesn't have a return value.
# Step 3: The body of the function opens an AudioInputStream from the sound data and starts playing it using AudioSystem.
# Step 4: The function's purpose is to play sound data.
# Step 5: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 6: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:

# Step 1: The function is named 'getRow' and takes a parameter: an integer 'r'.
# Step 2: The return type is 'RowVector', a custom data structure.
# Step 3: The function checks if the provided row index 'r' is valid.
# Step 4: If valid, it creates a new 'RowVector' and copies the values from the specified row of the matrix to the 'RowVector'.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to retrieve a specific row from a matrix based on the given index.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.

### Example 2:
 Input:
public static byte[] toByteArray(InputStream input) throws IOException {
    ByteArrayOutputStream buffer = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    int nRead;
    byte[] data = new byte[16384];
    while ((nRead = input.read(data, 0, data.length)) != -1) {
        buffer.write(data, 0, nRead);
    }
    buffer.flush();
    return buffer.toByteArray();
}

Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'toByteArray' and takes one parameter: an InputStream 'input'.
# Step 2: The return type is byte[], so the function converts an InputStream to a byte array.
# Step 3: The function reads data from the InputStream in chunks and writes it to a ByteArrayOutputStream.
# Step 4: After reading all data, it flushes the buffer and returns the byte array.
# Step 5: The function's purpose is to read an InputStream and return the contents as a byte array.
# Step 6: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:
Convert an InputStream to a byte array.

### Example 2:
 Input:
class Email {

    public static boolean isValid(String email) {
        return email.matches(EMAIL_PATTERN);
    }
}
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The function is named 'isValid' and takes one parameter: a String 'email'.
# Step 2: The return type is boolean, so the function returns true if the email is valid, and false otherwise.
# Step 3: The function uses a regular expression to check if the email matches the pattern.
# Step 4: The function's purpose is to validate the format of the email.
# Step 5: Since the function includes parameters and a return value, '@param' and '@return' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs and outputs.
# Step 6: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param and return tags.
Output:

### Example 2:
Input:
public void write(String filePath, String content) throws IOException {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath, true))) {
            writer.write(content);
        }
    }
Thought steps:
# Step 1: The method is named 'write' and takes two parameters: a String 'filePath' and a String 'content'.
# Step 2: The method does not return a value, so it is of type void.
# Step 3: The method writes the given content to a file specified by the file path.
# Step 4: It appends the content to the file if it already exists, or creates a new file if it does not.
# Step 5: The method's purpose is to write content to a file.
# Step 6: Since the method includes parameters and does not return a value, '@param' tags should be used to help users understand the inputs.
# Step 7: Because the user requests a brief summary, the final summary will be a short sentence, plus param tag.

Output:
Write content to a file, appending to existing content.
