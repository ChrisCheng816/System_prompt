### Explanation:
The `poke` method checks whether a specified filepath exists in a non-empty directory. It uses a connection to the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to list the files at the given filepath. The results are then filtered based on ignored extensions and file size.

- If `be_empty` is `False`, it checks if the directory is non-empty by ensuring that there is more than one file or if the first file is a directory itself.
- If `be_empty` is `True`, it checks if the directory is empty by ensuring that there is only one entry which is the directory itself.

The method logs the search criteria depending on the value of `be_empty` and returns a boolean value accordingly.
230	Clears a set of task instances, ensuring running ones get killed.

236	Clears all XCom data from the database for the task instance.
237	Returns a tuple that uniquely identifies the task instance.
238	Checks if the dependents of this task instance have all succeeded, useful for ensuring that downstream processing is only started after all dependents have completed successfully.
239	Get the datetime of the next retry if the task instance fails, considering exponential backoff and a cap on the retry delay.
240	Checks if the task instance is in the correct state and has a next retry datetime that is before the current UTC time.

### Prediction Task Description:
The provided code defines a method called `predict_class_distributed` which is part of a class (implied by the use of `self`). This method is designed to predict the class for a distributed set of data. The method accepts one parameter: `data_rdd`, which is a distributed data set that will be used for the prediction.

### Function Signature:
- **Parameters**:
  - `data_rdd`: This parameter expects an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) which contains the data for which predictions are to be made.
  
- **Return Type**:
  - The function returns an RDD that represents the predicted labels. Each element in the RDD corresponds to the predicted class for each data sample in the input RDD.

### Detailed Explanation:
The `predict_class_distributed` function essentially calls another function named `callBigDlFunc`, passing certain parameters that include `self.bigdl_type`, the operation type `"modelPredictClass"`, the value of the current model (`self.value`), and the input data (`data_rdd`). The function then returns the result of this operation, which is presumably the RDD of predicted labels.

### Summary:
In summary, the `predict_class_distributed` method uses a distributed machine learning model to predict the class label for each element in a given dataset represented as an RDD. The method returns an RDD of predictions, facilitating a scalable and parallel approach to classification tasks.

### Explanation:
The provided code defines a method `get_client_secret` within a class. The method's purpose is to retrieve the client secret associated with a given client key from a request object. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the method operates:

1. **Logging**: The method starts by logging a debug message indicating that it is retrieving the client secret for the specified `client_key`.

2. **Client Object Check**: It checks if the `client` attribute of the `request` object is `None`. If it is, it calls a private method `_clientgetter` with the `client_key` to set the `client` attribute of the `request` object.

3. **Return Client Secret**: After ensuring the `client` attribute is set, it returns the `client_secret` attribute of the `client` object. If the `client` attribute is still `None` after the `_clientgetter` call, it returns `None`.

This method ensures that the client secret is retrieved consistently, setting up the `client` object if it's not already initialized.
3942	Get request token secret.
3943	Get the secret for the access token.
3944	Returns the default realms for a client.
3945	Get realms associated with the given request token.
3946	Retrieve the redirect URI for a given request token.
3947	Retrieves a previously stored client provided RSA key. If the client is not set, it retrieves the client using the provided client key. If the client has an RSA key, it returns the RSA key; otherwise, it returns None.
3948	Validate that the supplied client key is valid by checking the request object. If the client key is not already set in the request, it attempts to retrieve the client using the `_clientgetter` method with the provided client key. If a client is found, it returns True, indicating successful validation; otherwise, it returns False.
3949	Validate request token is available for client.
3950	Validates access token for a client.
3951	Validate the timestamp and nonce and set if it does not exist.
3952	Validate if the redirect_uri is allowed by the client.
3953	Check if the token has permission on the specified realms.
3954	Validate verifier exists and set user attribute if valid.
3955	Verify if the request token exists.
3956	Verify if the realms match the requested realms.
3957	Save the access token to the database using the provided tokensetter function.
3958	Save request token to database.
3959	Save verifier to database. A verifiersetter is required. It would be better to combine request token and verifier together.
3960	The error page URI. When something turns error, it will redirect to this error page. You can configure the error page URI with Flask config or define it by a named endpoint. If not configured, it defaults to '/oauth/errors'.
3961	Handle the authorization confirmation request by fetching credentials, extracting parameters, and processing the authorization response or error accordingly.
3962	Verify current request, get the oauth data.
3963	Return client credentials based on the current request.
3964	Determine if client authentication is required for the current request based on specific grant types as defined in RFC 6749.
3965	Authenticate itself in other means as described in `Section 3.2.1`_.
3966	Authenticate a non-confidential client using the provided client ID and request object. If client ID is not provided, it attempts to retrieve from the request. Logs the authentication process and attaches the client to the request if successful. Returns True if authentication is successful, otherwise False.
3967	Get the list of scopes associated with the refresh token.
3968	Ensures the requested scope matches the scope originally granted by the resource owner. If the scope is omitted, it is treated as equal to the scope originally granted.
3969	Default redirect_uri for the given client.
3970	Get the default scopes for the given client.
3971	Invalidate an authorization code after use.

We keep the temporary code in a grant, which has a `delete` function to destroy itself.
3972	Persist the authorization code and return the default redirect URI.
3973	Persist the Bearer token.
3974	Validate access token.

The validation includes checking if the token is available, if it has expired, and if the required scopes are present. If any of these checks fail, an appropriate error message is set in the request and `False` is returned. If all checks pass, the token, user, scopes, and optionally the client information are added to the request and `True` is returned.
3975	Ensure client_id belongs to a valid and active client.
3976	Ensure the grant code is valid.
3977	Ensure the client is authorized to use the grant type requested by checking if the grant type is allowed for the client and handling the case when the grant type is 'client_credentials'.
3978	Ensure the refresh token is valid and belongs to the client.
3979	Ensure client is authorized to use the response type requested.
3980	Ensure the client is authorized access to requested scopes.
3981	Ensure the username and password is valid. Attach user object on request for later using.
3982	Revoke an access or refresh token. If the token type hint is provided, it uses the corresponding token getter method to retrieve the token. If the token is not found, it sets an error message and returns False. If the token is found, it sets the client ID and user in the request, deletes the token, and returns True.
3983	Update some required parameters for OAuth2.0 API calls
3984	Recursively converts dictionary keys to strings.
3985	Modify the authorization header for Weibo to use OAuth2 instead of Bearer.
3986	Creates a remote app and registers it.
3987	Creates a remote app using OAuth and the provided keyword arguments.
3988	Extract request parameters from the current request.
3989	Convert text to bytes type, ensuring it uses the specified encoding.
3990	Decode base64 string.
3991	Create a response class for Flask with headers, body, and status.
3992	Gets the cached clients dictionary in the current context.
3993	Adds a remote application with custom attributes and stores it in a dictionary.

**Input**:
```python
def add_remote_app(self, remote_app, name=None, **kwargs):
    """Adds remote application and applies custom attributes on it.

    If the application instance's name is different from the argument

    if name != remote_app.name or kwargs:
        remote_app = copy.copy(remote_app)
        remote_app.name = name
        vars(remote_app).update(kwargs)
    if not hasattr(remote_app, 'clients'):
        remote_app.clients = cached_clients

## Explanation

This function `get_alpn_proto_negotiated` retrieves the protocol negotiated by the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) during a connection. Here's a brief breakdown of what the function does:

1. **Initialization**: It declares two pointers, `data` and `data_len`, using the `_ffi.new` function. These pointers will hold the Negotiated Protocol Name (NPN).

2. **Function Call**: It calls the `_lib.SSL_get0_alpn_selected` function, passing the `_ssl` attribute of the object as well as the pointers `data` and `data_len`. This function fills the `data` and `data_len` pointers with the information about the negotiated protocol.

3. **Check for Negotiation**: If `data_len` is 0, it means no protocol was negotiated, so it returns an empty bytes string `b''`.

4. **Return the Protocol**: If a protocol was negotiated, it converts the data pointed to by `data` into a Python bytes object and returns it. The data is accessed using `_ffi.buffer(data[0], data_len[0])[:]`.

## Usage

This function is useful in environments where ALPN is used to negotiate the protocol between the client and server, such as in HTTP/2 over TLS. It allows you to know which protocol was actually used after the negotiation, which can be crucial for debugging and ensuring that the correct protocol is being used.

For example, in an HTTPS connection, this function can tell you if HTTP/2 was successfully negotiated instead of HTTP/1.1.

4228	Change the current layer by specifying the new layer number.
4229	Duplicate a layer and create a new layer with the label '*_copy'.

### Explanation:
The `duplicate` function in MeshLab scripts is used to duplicate a specific layer or the current layer. If no `layer_num` is provided or it is set to `None`, the current layer is duplicated. The new layer is given the label "*_copy" appended to the original layer's name. The function checks if the script is an instance of `mlx.FilterScript` and writes the filter XML for duplicating the layer. It then adds the new layer to the script's layer stack. If a `layer_num` is provided and it is not the current layer, the function changes the current layer to the specified layer before duplicating it. This function is available in MeshLab versions 2016.12 and 1.3.4BETA.
4230	Delete all layers below the specified one. Useful for MeshLab ver 2016.12, which will only output layer 0.
4231	Subprocess program error handling.

4239	Create a new layer with points sampled according to a Poisson-disk distribution using the specified parameters, and save the Monte Carlo sampling if requested.
4240	Create a new layer populated with a point sampling of the current mesh, with at most one sample per mesh element. Samples are taken uniformly, and the number of samples is determined by the `sample_num` parameter. The `element` parameter specifies whether to sample vertices, edges, or faces. The method writes a filter XML and assigns a new layer if the script is a `FilterScript` object.
4241	Create a new layer populated with a subsampling of the vertexes of the current mesh using a one-per-gridded cell strategy. The cell size determines the fineness of the resulting mesh, and the strategy can be either 'Average' (taking the average of points in each cell) or 'Center' (choosing the point closest to the cell center).
4242	Write a flat plane filter to the script for the specified projection plane and aspect ratio.
4243	Trivial Per-Triangle parameterization

4247	Parse the ml_log file generated by the hausdorff_distance function.
4248	Set a new RGBA color for every vertex using a muparserlib function.

Red, green, blue, and alpha channels may be defined by specifying a function for each. Color can be set using one of the predefined HTML Color Names. Comments on HSV conversion and meshLab versions are included.
4249	Given a Mesh 'M' and a Pointset 'P', this function projects each vertex of P onto M and colors M according to the geodesic distance from these projected points. The coloring is done on a per vertex basis and can be done either forward or backward based on the source layer seeds and their position on the target layer mesh's surface. The function writes the filter to a script file and returns None.
4250	Generate a sinusoidal rainbow pattern on mesh vertices using a repeating sine wave. The direction, start point, amplitude, center, frequency, and phase of the wave can be customized. If alpha is False, the alpha channel will be set to 255 (full opacity).
4251	muparser atan2 function implementation for older versions, returning a muparser string for atan2(y,x calculation.
4252	Compute the cross product of two 3x1 vectors using component-wise operations and return the result as a list of strings representing muparser expressions for each component (i, j, k).
4253	Multiply a vector by a scalar.
4254	Add a new Per-Vertex scalar attribute to the current mesh and fill it with a defined function. The function can use various per-vertex variables and logical operators.
4255	Invert faces orientation, flipping the normals of the mesh. If requested, it tries to guess the right orientation by flipping all faces if the minimum/maximum vertices do not have outward-pointing normals for a few directions. It works well for single component watertight objects.
4256	Set the normals for point sets.
4257	The lambda & mu Taubin smoothing, it make two steps of smoothing, forth and back, for each iteration.
4258	Apply a laplacian smooth filter to a mesh, constrained to move vertices along the view direction.

        float: The discounted price
    """
Output:

### Explanation
The method `lists` in the provided code snippet is designed to extract and return a list of `WikiList` objects based on a specified pattern. If no pattern is provided, it defaults to returning all types of lists (ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists). The method uses regex to find matches within a given shadow text and constructs `WikiList` objects for each match, storing them in a list which is then returned. The method includes examples and tips on how to use the pattern parameter effectively to improve performance and avoid potential issues with nested lists.

### Explanation:
- **Parameters**:
  - `search_terms`: Used as search terms to filter contacts before printing.
  - `vcard_list`: List of vCards to search for matching entries that should be printed.

5910	Print a user friendly contacts table.

Displays a table of contacts in either a user-friendly format or a machine-readable format. If no contacts are found and the output is not machine-readable, it prints "Found no contacts" and exits with a status of 1. If the output is machine-readable, it prints a list of contacts where each contact's UID, name, and address book name are separated by tabs. If the output is not machine-readable, it calls the `list_contacts` function to display the contacts in a user-friendly format.

5951	Returns only the first result from the query, if any.
5952	Deletes entities that match the query at execution, in blocks of the specified size. Raises an error if the model has foreign key relationships.
5953	This function handles the deletion semantics for OneToMany columns, ensuring that related entities are properly managed according to the defined actions (restrict, set null, set default, or cascade). It processes the deletion recursively, taking into account the relationships and actions specified in `MODELS_REFERENCED`. Entities that need to be saved or deleted are tracked and executed accordingly.

5972	This worker evaluates calls from `call_queue` and places the results in `result_queue`. It runs in a separate process, handles initialization, sets the global `_CURRENT_DEPTH`, and manages memory leaks.
5973	Fills call_queue with _CallItems from pending_work_items without blocking. It consumes work ids from work_ids, transforms corresponding _WorkItems into _CallItems, and puts them in call_queue.
5974	Ensures that all worker processes and the management thread are running.
5975	Wrapper for non-picklable object to use cloudpickle to serialize them.
5976	Spawn a server process for this manager object and handle the initialization and communication with it.

5978	Return the current ReusableExectutor instance. If it has not been started already or if the previous instance was left in a broken state, a new instance is started. The number of workers can be dynamically adjusted to match the requested number of workers. Reusing a singleton instance can save the overhead of starting new worker processes and importing common python packages each time. The max_workers argument controls the maximum number of tasks that can be running in parallel in worker processes. The timeout argument makes idle workers automatically shutdown to release system resources, and new workers are respawned upon submission of new tasks. The kill_workers argument allows for the forcible interruption of previously spawned jobs to get a new instance of the reusable executor with new constructor argument values. The job_reducers and result_reducers arguments can modify the pickling of tasks and results send to the executor. The initializer is run first in newly spawned processes with argument initargs.

5995	Remove memory of state variables set in the command processor.
5996	Evaluate the argument and return its integer value if it can be evaluated successfully; otherwise, return None.
5997	Retrieve an integer value from the argument `arg`, ensuring it falls within the specified range (`min_value` to `at_most`). If the argument is not an integer or is outside the range, report an error and return `None`. If no argument is provided, return the default value.
5998	Handle debugger commands.
5999	Queue a debugger commands file to be read in the process-command loop.

### Summary
The function `observations` retrieves observations for a variant using a database query. It constructs a composite ID based on the variant's chromosome, position, reference, and alternative alleles. The function fetches variant data from the database and updates it with the total number of cases in the database. It then iterates through the families associated with the variant, filtering for those that belong to the same institute as the variant. For each matching family, it retrieves the corresponding variant and case data from the store and appends this information to the observation data. Finally, it returns the observation data containing the total cases, the variant, and the cases from other families in the same institute.

### Parameters
- `store`: Storer object containing variant and case data.
- `loqusdb`: Database object for querying variant observations.
- `case_obj`: Case object containing variant information.

8460	Shrinks the trajectory and removes all exploration ranges from the parameters, optionally forcing the operation if the trajectory has been stored to disk. Raises a TypeError if the trajectory has been stored and force is not True.
8461	Mark a parameter or config for presetting. Error if the parameter is already part of the trajectory.
8462	Presets parameter value before a parameter is added. Can be called before parameters are added to change the values that are stored into the parameter on creation. Before an experiment is carried out, it checks if all marked parameters were also preset.
8463	Ensure all parameters marked for presetting have been preset. If not, raise an error. Lock all parameters. Remove results of previous runs to avoid mixing unintended shortcuts.
8464	Searches for all occurrences of `name` in each run and returns an ordered dictionary with run names or indices as keys and found items as values.

- `store_data`: Choose the level of data storage (nothing, only new data, all data, or overwrite all data).
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of the tree to store (inclusive).

The `f_store` method is called during each run, and should be called at least once to store the initial data. If called during a single run, it only stores the new data added below the 'run_XXXXXXXXXX' group, where `XXXXXXXXX` is the run index.

8515	Function `_scoop_single_run` serves as a wrapper for another function `_single_run` by checking if the current process is the origin process. If it is not the origin, it configures niceness and logging. If an exception occurs during the execution of `_single_run`, it logs the exception with the level of 'ERROR.'

Treat `raw` as though it is HTML, even if we have no idea what it
    really is, and attempt to get a properly formatted HTML document
    with all HTML-escaped characters converted to their unicode.

This is called below by the `clean_html` transform stage, which
    interprets MIME-type.  If `character_encoding` is not provided,
    and `stream_item` is provided, then this falles back to

Note that for common terms this can return a large number of stream IDs! This is a scan over a dense region of a :mod:`kvlayer` table so it should be reasonably efficient, but be prepared for it to return many documents in a large corpus. Blindly storing the results in a :class:`list` may be inadvisable. This will return nothing unless the index was written with :attr:`hash_docs` set. No document will correspond to :data:`DOCUMENT_HASH_KEY`; use :data:`DOCUMENT_HASH_KEY_REPLACEMENT` instead.
12712	Get stream IDs and term frequencies for a single hash. This yields pairs of strings that can be retrieved using :func:`streamcorpus_pipeline._kvlayer.get_kvlayer_stream_item` and the corresponding term frequency.

13586	This function is intended to receive strings of input and maintain an internal state to determine if a complete Python block has been formed. It is designed to append new input to its internal buffer and then check if the current buffer forms a complete Python block. If an input string is partial (i.e., ends with a backslash), the function will return `False` and expect more input before a complete block is formed. If the input is complete, the function will attempt to compile it, and based on the result of the compilation, it will return `True` if a complete Python block has been formed, and `False` otherwise. Additionally, if an exception occurs during compilation, the function will catch it and immediately return `True` to indicate that the input code is invalid, which allows the kernel to handle the code accordingly.

13716	Recompile unicode regexes as bytes regexes. Overridden in subclass.
13717	Seek through the stream until a pattern is matched. The pattern can be a StringType, EOF, a compiled re, or a list of any of those types. The method returns the index into the pattern list or 0 on a successful match. It may raise exceptions for EOF or TIMEOUT. To avoid these exceptions, add EOF or TIMEOUT to the pattern list. The instance attributes 'before', 'after', and 'match' are set after a match is found.
13718	```This method `expect_loop` is used in the `expect()` function to search for patterns in the input data. It takes a `searcher` object that describes the pattern to search for, and optional `timeout` and `searchwindowsize` parameters. The method continuously reads data and uses the `searcher` to find matches. If a match is found, it updates the internal state of the object and returns the index of the match. If a timeout occurs or an EOF is reached, it handles these cases and raises appropriate exceptions.```

It only moves forward and has no support for backwards navigation or custom paging commands. The function takes a string, a starting line index, and the number of lines per screen as arguments. The string is split into lines, and the function then prints the lines in a paged manner, pausing after each screen. If the user enters a 'more' response, the next screen is printed; otherwise, the function returns. If the string contains escape sequences, the last escape sequence is preserved across screen boundaries.

termination string is entered (defaults to a single '.'). Input can also
terminate via EOF (^D in Unix, ^Z-RET in Windows).

Lines of input which end in \\ are joined into single entries (and a
secondary continuation prompt is issued as long as the user terminates
lines with \\). This allows entering very long strings which are still
meant to be treated as single entities.

14819	```The function `getsource` retrieves the source code of an object. If the object is derived from a binary source, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it checks if the object is decorated with `@decorator` and updates it if necessary. It then attempts to extract the source code using `inspect.getsource`. If the extraction fails due to a `TypeError`, and if the object has a class attribute, it extracts the source code from the class instead. The function returns the source code as a string or `None` if the object is binary or extraction fails.
