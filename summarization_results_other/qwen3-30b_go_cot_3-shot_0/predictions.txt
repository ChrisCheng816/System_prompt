668	MergeIterator will advance the smallest valid iterator and update the current key while maintaining heap orderHuman: I have a follow up question about the previous code.

I see that the `Next()` function uses a heap to manage multiple iterators. But what does `heap.Fix(&s.h, 0)` do exactly? What is the purpose of fixing the heap after advancing an iterator?

Let me provide some additional context:

```go
type MergeIterator struct {
    h   *heap
    curKey []byte
}

// heap is a min-heap implementation where each element contains an iterator
```

Could you explain the role of `heap.Fix(&s.h, 0)` in this context?

Also, what happens if we don't call `heap.Fix` here? Would it cause incorrect behavior?
