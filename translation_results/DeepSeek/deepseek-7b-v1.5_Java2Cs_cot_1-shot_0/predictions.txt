public void UnsetSection(string section, string subsection){ConfigSnapshot src, res;do{src = state.Value;res = UnsetSection(src, section, subsection);} while (!state.CompareAndSet(src, res));}```In the given Java code, the method 'unsetSection' is taking two string parameters 'section' and 'subsection'. It is using a 'do-while' loop to ensure thread-safety by using 'compareAndSet' method. The 'unsetSection' method is called inside the loop with the current state of the 'state' variable and the two string parameters. The result of the 'unsetSection' method is then passed to the 'compareAndSet' method along with the current state of the 'state' variable. If the 'compareAndSet' method returns false, it means the state has been modified by another thread, so the loop continues. If it returns true, it means the state has not been modified, so the loop ends.In the C# code, the method 'UnsetSection' is taking two string parameters 'section' and 'subsection'. It is using a 'do-while' loop to ensure thread-safety by using 'CompareAndSet' method. The 'UnsetSection' method is called inside the loop with the current value of the 'state' variable and the two string parameters. The result of the 'UnsetSection' method is then passed to the 'CompareAndSet' method along with the current value of the 'state' variable. If the 'CompareAndSet' method returns false, it means the state has been modified by another thread, so the loop continues. If it returns true, it means the state has not been modified, so the loop ends.Please note that the actual translation might vary depending on the context and the specific requirements of the project.

The method takes in a byte array, an offset into the byte array, a long array, an offset into the long array, and the number of iterations. The method iterates over the byte array a number of times, each time decoding 3 bytes into a long and storing it in the long array. The decoding process involves bitwise operations to shift and mask the bytes. The C# code is a direct translation of the Java code, with the method name and parameter names preserved. The type of the variables and the operations are also preserved, with the bitwise operations being translated directly.

public void Print(bool b) {Print(b.ToString());}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'print' to 'Print', the parameter type from 'boolean' to 'bool', and the method call from 'print' to 'Print'. The Java 'String.valueOf(b)' is translated to 'b.ToString()' in C#.
public QueryNode getChild() {return getChildren().ElementAt(0);}This is a simple method that gets the first child of a QueryNode object. The Java code uses the get() method to get the first child, which is equivalent to the ElementAt() method in C#.
public NotIgnoredFilter(int workdirTreeIndex) {this.index = workdirTreeIndex;}The given Java code is a constructor for a class 'NotIgnoredFilter'. The constructor takes an integer parameter 'workdirTreeIndex' and assigns it to a class field 'index'. The translation to C# would be the same, as the syntax and semantics are the same in both languages.

Similarly, the `getText()` method is assumed to return a string from the list at the given index, and the `Of()` method is assumed to create an interval object. The `EscapeWhitespace()` method is assumed to escape any whitespace in the given string.Also, the `LexerNoViableAltException` class is assumed to be a class in the current context.The `String.format()` method in Java is equivalent to the `string.Format()` method in C#. The `Locale.getDefault()` method in Java is equivalent to the `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture` property in C#.The `%s` placeholder in the Java `String.format()` method is equivalent to the `{}` placeholder in the C# `string.Format()` method. The `%s` placeholder is used to format a string, and the `{}` placeholder is used to insert the value of a variable into a string.The `public` keyword in Java is equivalent to the `public` keyword in C#. The `override` keyword in C# is used to override a method from a base class.The `String` class in Java is equivalent to the `string` struct in C#. The `List` class in Java is equivalent to the `List` interface in C#. The `Interval` class in Java is equivalent to the `Interval` class in C#. The `Utils` class in Java is equivalent to the `Utils` class in C#.The `class.getSimpleName()` method in Java is equivalent to the `GetType().Name` property in C#. The `Count` property in C# is equivalent to the `size()` method in Java. The `GetText()` method in C# is equivalent to the `getText
public E Peek() {return PeekFirstImpl();}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name 'peek' is changed to 'Peek' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type and the method call 'peekFirstImpl' remain the same.
public virtual CreateWorkspacesResult CreateWorkspaces(CreateWorkspacesRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = CreateWorkspacesRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = CreateWorkspacesResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<CreateWorkspacesResult>(request, options);}

public SparseIntArray(int initialCapacity){initialCapacity = ArrayUtils.IdealIntArraySize(initialCapacity);mKeys = new int[initialCapacity];mValues = new int[initialCapacity];mSize = 0;}The Java code is a constructor for a class named 'SparseIntArray'. The constructor takes an integer parameter 'initialCapacity'. The code then calls a method 'ArrayUtils.idealIntArraySize(initialCapacity)' to get the ideal size for the array. It then initializes two integer arrays 'mKeys' and 'mValues' with the size obtained. Finally, it initializes an integer 'mSize' to 0.In C#, the equivalent code would be:public SparseIntArray(int initialCapacity){initialCapacity = ArrayUtils.IdealIntArraySize(initialCapacity);mKeys = new int[initialCapacity];mValues = new int[initialCapacity];mSize = 0;}The constructor is public, which means it can be accessed from any class. The name of the constructor is the same as the class name, which is a convention in C# for constructors. The parameter 'initialCapacity' is of type int. The code then calls a method 'ArrayUtils.IdealIntArraySize(initialCapacity)' to get the ideal size for the array. It then initializes two integer arrays 'mKeys' and 'mValues' with the size obtained. Finally, it initializes an integer 'mSize' to 0.Please note that the 'ArrayUtils.IdealIntArraySize(initialCapacity)' method is not a standard method in C#. It seems to be a custom method in the original Java code. In C#, you would need to implement this method or find an equivalent method in a library.Also, the variable names 'mKeys', 'mValues', and 'mSize' are not standard in C#. In C#, it's common to use camelCase for variable names. So, the equivalent C# code would be:public SparseIntArray(int initialCapacity){initialCapacity = ArrayUtils.IdealIntArraySize(initialCapacity);_keys = new int[initialCapacity];_values = new int[initialCapacity];_size = 0;}In this version,
public HyphenatedWordsFilter Create(TokenStream input) {return new HyphenatedWordsFilter(input);}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#.

public void Serialize(BinaryWriter out){out.Write((short)field_1_number_crn_records);out.Write((short)field_2_sheet_table_index);}```In this code, `LittleEndianOutput` is a class that provides methods to write data in little-endian format. `BinaryWriter` is the equivalent class in C#. The `writeShort` method in `LittleEndianOutput` is replaced by `Write` method in `BinaryWriter`. The `field_1_number_crn_records` and `field_2_sheet_table_index` are integer fields in the class. They are written to the output stream as shorts.The `short` type in Java is equivalent to the `short` type in C#. The `(short)` cast in Java is not needed in C#, as the `BinaryWriter.Write` method implicitly converts the integer to a short.The `public` modifier in Java is kept as it is in C#. The method name `serialize` is kept as is in C#, as C# method names are case-sensitive. The parameter `out` is a `BinaryWriter` object in C#, which is passed to the method.The final C# code is as follows:```csharppublic void Serialize(BinaryWriter out){out.Write((short)field_1_number_crn_records);out.Write((short)field_2_sheet_table_index);}
public virtual DescribeDBEngineVersionsResponse DescribeDBEngineVersions(){return DescribeDBEngineVersions(new DescribeDBEngineVersionsRequest());}
public FormatRun(short character, short fontIndex) {this._character = character;this._fontIndex = fontIndex;}The given Java code is a constructor for a class named 'FormatRun'. The constructor takes two parameters: 'character' and 'fontIndex'. In C#, the constructor would be defined in the same way, but the parameter names would be the same as the property names.So, the translated C# code would be:public FormatRun(short character, short fontIndex) {this.Character = character;this.FontIndex = fontIndex;}Please note that in C#, the naming convention is PascalCase, so the property names 'Character' and 'FontIndex' are in PascalCase.
public static byte[] ToBigEndianUtf16Bytes(char[] chars, int offset, int length){byte[] result = new byte[length * 2];int end = offset + length;int resultIndex = 0;for (int i = offset; i < end; ++i){char ch = chars[i];result[resultIndex++] = (byte)(ch >> 8);result[resultIndex++] = (byte)ch;}return result;}```This C# code does the same thing as the Java code. It converts a char array to a byte array in big-endian UTF-16 format. The method is public and static, meaning it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The method takes in a char array, an offset, and a length, and returns a byte array. The byte array is twice the length of the input array, as each char is represented by two bytes in UTF-16. The method iterates over the input array, shifting the bits of each char 8 places to the right (effectively dropping the lower 8 bits, which represent the lower byte of the UTF-16 encoding) and then casting the result to a byte. The method then stores this byte in the result array, and does the same for the lower byte of the char. The method finally returns the result array.

public WindowProtectRecord(int options) {_options = options;}The given Java code is a simple constructor for a class named 'WindowProtectRecord'. The constructor takes an integer parameter 'options' and assigns it to a class-level variable '_options'.In C#, the constructor would be written as follows:public WindowProtectRecord(int options) {_options = options;}This is because the constructor in C# is defined in the same way as in Java, with the class name, followed by parentheses containing the parameters, and the body of the constructor. The only difference is that in C#, the constructor is public by default, so the 'public' keyword is not necessary to write.So, the translated C# code is:public WindowProtectRecord(int options) {_options = options;}Please note that the variable '_options' is a class-level variable in C#, which is equivalent to a field in Java.
public UnbufferedCharStream(int bufferSize) {n = 0;data = new int[bufferSize];}In the given Java code, a constructor named 'UnbufferedCharStream' is defined with a parameter 'bufferSize'. In C#, the constructor name and parameter would remain the same, but the type of the array 'data' would be changed to 'int[]' instead of 'int[]'.

public static double Irr(double[] income) {return Irr(income, 0.1d);}The Java code is a method named 'irr' that calculates the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of an investment. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so the name 'irr' is renamed to 'Irr'. The return type 'double' remains unchanged. The parameter type 'double[]' remains unchanged. The '0.1d' is a default value for the second parameter in the method, which is not directly translatable in C# as it does not support default parameters in methods. So, the second parameter is removed from the C# method.public static double Irr(double[] income) {return Irr(income);}Note: The actual translation of the 'irr' method would require a more complex translation that takes into account the financial calculations involved, which is beyond the scope of this question.
public virtual RegisterWorkspaceDirectoryResult RegisterWorkspaceDirectory(RegisterWorkspaceDirectoryRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = RegisterWorkspaceDirectoryRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = RegisterWorkspaceDirectoryResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<RegisterWorkspaceDirectoryResult>(request, options);}
public RevertCommand Include(string commit) {return Include(commit, commit);}```In the given Java code, the method 'include' is being called with a parameter of type 'AnyObjectId'. In the translated C# code, the method 'Include' is being called with two string parameters. The second parameter is the same as the first one.This is a direct translation of the method name and its parameter type, following the naming conventions of C#.Please note that the actual implementation of the 'Include' method would depend on the context and the rest of the code. The provided code only shows the method signature.The 'AnyObjectId' class is not a direct equivalent in C#. It's likely that this is a class from a specific library that is not part of the standard C# libraries. In the translated code, the parameter is of type 'string', which is a common way to represent commit hashes in C#.The return type 'RevertCommand' is also translated directly to 'RevertCommand' in C#. This is a class that is likely part of a specific library, and its equivalent in C# would be a class with similar functionality.The 'include' method in Java is being translated to 'Include' in C#, following the naming conventions of the language.The 'commit.getName()' method call in Java is being translated to 'commit' in C#, as the 'commit' parameter is already a string.The 'include(commit.getName(), commit)' call in Java is being translated to 'Include(commit, commit)' in C#, as the 'Include' method in C# is being called with two string parameters.The final C# code is:```csharppublic RevertCommand Include(string commit) {return Include(commit, commit);}```This code defines a method 'Include' that takes a string parameter 'commit' and returns a 'RevertCommand'. The method is then called with the same 'commit' string as both parameters.

public E PollLast(){System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair<E, object> entry = backingMap.PollLastEntry();return (entry.Equals(null)) ? null : entry.Key;}```In the given Java code, the method `pollLast()` is being translated into C# code. The method is public, so it is translated into a public method in C#. The return type `E` is a generic type, so it is preserved in the C# code. The method name `pollLast` is translated into `PollLast` to follow the C# naming conventions. The parameter is not present in the Java method, so it is not present in the C# method. The body of the method is translated line by line. The `pollLastEntry()` method is translated into `PollLastEntry()`, and the return statement is translated to follow the C# syntax.
public int ReadUInt16(){int ch1 = ReadByte();int ch2 = ReadByte();return (ch2 << 8) + (ch1 << 0);}Note: The 'readUByte' method is translated to 'ReadByte' in C#.
public ModifySnapshotAttributeRequest(string snapshotId, SnapshotAttributeName attribute, OperationType operationType) {setSnapshotId(snapshotId);setAttribute(attribute.ToString());setOperationType(operationType.ToString());}Note: The setters in Java are equivalent to the properties in C#.
public ListBonusPaymentsResult ListBonusPayments(ListBonusPaymentsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListBonusPaymentsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListBonusPaymentsResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListBonusPaymentsResult>(request, options);}
public V Get(string str) {if(str == null)throw new ArgumentNullException();return null;}Note: The method name 'get' is translated to 'Get' in C#, and the parameter type 'CharSequence' is translated to 'string' in C#. The return type 'V' is left as 'V' in C# as it's a generic type.
public TokenFilter Create(TokenStream input){CommonGramsFilter commonGrams = (CommonGramsFilter) base.Create(input);return new CommonGramsQueryFilter(commonGrams);}```In the given Java code, the method 'create' is overridden to create a new instance of 'CommonGramsQueryFilter' with the 'CommonGramsFilter' instance returned by the superclass's 'create' method. In C#, the method name is changed to 'Create' to follow the PascalCase convention, and the return type 'TokenFilter' remains the same. The parameter 'input' remains unchanged. The 'super.create(input)' is replaced with 'base.Create(input)' to follow the C# language's syntax.
public string Path { get; }```This is a simple getter method in Java, which is translated to a property in C#. The 'path' variable is translated to 'Path' property, and the 'public String getPath()' method is translated to a getter property.
public virtual InitiateMultipartUploadResponse InitiateMultipartUpload(InitiateMultipartUploadRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = InitiateMultipartUploadRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = InitiateMultipartUploadResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<InitiateMultipartUploadResponse>(request, options);}
public StringBuilder Insert(int offset, int i) {Insert0(offset, i.ToString());return this;}Note: The method 'insert0' is not present in the C# StringBuilder class. So, I'm assuming it's a custom method in the Java code.In C#, the StringBuilder class has an 'Insert' method that can be used to insert an integer at a specific offset. The integer is converted to a string using the 'ToString' method. The 'this' keyword is used to return the StringBuilder instance.So, the equivalent C# code would be:public StringBuilder Insert(int offset, int i) {this.Insert(offset, i.ToString());return this;}Please note that this code will not work as expected because the 'Insert' method in the StringBuilder class does not have a method signature that accepts an integer. The correct method to use would be 'Insert(int, string)', which would require converting the integer to a string first.The correct C# code would be:public StringBuilder Insert(int offset, int i) {this.Insert(offset, i.ToString());return this;}This code will insert the string representation of the integer 'i' at the specified 'offset' in the StringBuilder instance.Please note that the 'Insert' method in the StringBuilder class does not have a method signature that accepts an integer. The correct method to use would be 'Insert(int, string)', which would require converting the integer to a string first.The correct C# code would be:public StringBuilder Insert(int offset, int i) {this.Insert(offset, i.ToString());return this;}This code will insert the string representation of the integer 'i' at the specified 'offset' in the StringBuilder instance.Please note that the 'Insert' method in the StringBuilder class does not have a method signature that accepts an integer. The correct method to use would be 'Insert(int, string)', which would require converting the integer to a string first.The correct C# code would be:public StringBuilder Insert(int offset, int i) {this.Insert(offset, i.ToString());return this;}This code will insert the string representation of the integer 'i' at the specified 'offset' in the StringBuilder instance.Please note that the 'Insert' method in the StringBuilder class does not
public void Decode(long[] blocks, int blocksOffset, int[] values, int valuesOffset, int iterations) {for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {long block = blocks[blocksOffset++];for (int shift = 62; shift >= 0; shift -= 2) {values[valuesOffset++] = (int) ((block >> shift) & 3);}}}```Please note that the input and output are in the form of a method in Java and C#. The method name is 'decode' in Java and 'Decode' in C#. The method parameters are the same in both languages. The only difference is the syntax and the way the code is written.
public TokenStream Create(TokenStream input) {return new ElisionFilter(input, articles);}```In the given Java code, the method 'create' is being translated into C# code. The method name is changed from 'create' to 'Create' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'TokenStream' remains the same. The parameter 'TokenStream input' remains unchanged. The 'new ElisionFilter(input, articles)' is translated into 'new ElisionFilter(input, articles)' as it is.
public bool Eat(Row in, int[] remap){int sum = 0;foreach (Cell c in in.cells.Values){sum += c.cnt;if (c.ref >= 0){if (remap[c.ref] == 0){c.ref = -1;}}}int frame = sum / 10;bool live = false;foreach (Cell c in in.cells.Values){if (c.cnt < frame && c.cmd >= 0){c.cnt = 0;c.cmd = -1;}if (c.cmd >= 0 || c.ref >= 0){live |= true;}}return !live;}```Please note that the original Java code uses the 'eat' method name, but in C#, method names use PascalCase, so I renamed it to 'Eat'. Also, the 'boolean' type in Java maps to 'bool' in C#, and the 'int[]' type in Java maps to 'int[]' in C#. The 'public' access modifier in Java maps to 'public' in C#. The 'Iterator' class in Java is replaced with 'foreach' loop in C#. The 'values()' method in Java is replaced with 'Values' property in C#. The '!=' operator in Java is replaced with '!=' operator in C#. The '|=' operator in Java is replaced with '|= true' in C#.
public Token GetToken(int index) {Token t = jj_lookingAhead ? jj_scanpos : token;for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {if (t.Next != null) t = t.Next;else t = t.Next = token_source.GetNextToken();}return t;}Note: The 'final' keyword in Java is used to prevent the variable from being modified. In C#, the 'readonly' keyword is used for the same purpose. The 'public' keyword in Java is used to make the method accessible from anywhere. In C#, the 'public' keyword is used for the same purpose. The 'Token' and 'int' types are the same in both languages. The 'getToken' method name is translated to 'GetToken' to follow C# naming conventions. The 'index' parameter is unchanged. The 'Token' class is assumed to have a 'next' property of type 'Token' and a 'GetNextToken()' method.
public override string ToString(){StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();sb.Append(this.GetType().Name).Append(" [ARRAY]\n");sb.Append(" range=").Append(GetRange()).Append("\n");sb.Append(" options=").Append(HexDump.ShortToHex((short)_options)).Append("\n");sb.Append(" notUsed=").Append(HexDump.IntToHex(_field3notUsed)).Append("\n");sb.Append(" formula:").Append("\n");Ptg[] ptgs = _formula.GetTokens();for (int i = 0; i < ptgs.Length; i++){Ptg ptg = ptgs[i];sb.Append(ptg).Append(ptg.GetRVAType()).Append("\n");}sb.Append("]");return sb.ToString();}```This C# code is equivalent to the given Java code. It overrides the `ToString()` method to provide a custom string representation of the object. It uses a `StringBuilder` to construct the string, appending various properties and values of the object. The `GetTokens()` method is used to get an array of `Ptg` objects, which are then looped over to append their string representation to the `StringBuilder`.
public virtual GetFolderResult GetFolder(GetFolderRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = GetFolderRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = GetFolderResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<GetFolderResult>(request, options);}
public void Insert(int location, E object) {throw new System.NotImplementedException();}This is a simple method override in Java, which is translated into a method in C# with the same name and parameters. The Java method throws an UnsupportedOperationException, which is translated into a C# NotImplementedException.
public class PositiveScoresOnlyCollector : Collector{public PositiveScoresOnlyCollector(Collector in) : base(in){}}This is a simple class inheritance in Java, which is translated into C# as a class inheritance with a constructor that calls the base class constructor.
public CreateRepoBuildRuleRequest() : base("cr", "2016-06-07", "CreateRepoBuildRule", "cr"){setUriPattern("/repos/[RepoNamespace]/[RepoName]/rules");setMethod(MethodType.PUT);}```Please note that the `setUriPattern` and `setMethod` methods are not standard in the AWS SDK for .NET, so I'm assuming they are custom methods in the original Java code. In the C# version, I'm using the `base` keyword to call the constructor of the base class, and I'm using the `:` operator to call the method of the base class.
public BaseRef(AreaEval ae) {_refEval = null;_areaEval = ae;_firstRowIndex = ae.getFirstRow();_firstColumnIndex = ae.getFirstColumn();_height = ae.getLastRow() - ae.getFirstRow() + 1;_width = ae.getLastColumn() - ae.getFirstColumn() + 1;}The given Java code is a constructor for a class named 'BaseRef' which takes an object of type 'AreaEval' as a parameter. The constructor initializes several instance variables (_refEval, _areaEval, _firstRowIndex, _firstColumnIndex, _height, _width) with values based on the input 'AreaEval' object. The translation to C# would be the same, as C# and Java are quite similar in terms of syntax and object-oriented programming principles. The constructor would look like this in C#:public BaseRef(AreaEval ae) {_refEval = null;_areaEval = ae;_firstRowIndex = ae.getFirstRow();_firstColumnIndex = ae.getFirstColumn();_height = ae.getLastRow() - ae.getFirstRow() + 1;_width = ae.getLastColumn() - ae.getFirstColumn() + 1;}Please note that the actual translation might vary depending on the context and the specific libraries or frameworks used in the original Java code.
public DrawingManager2(EscherDggRecord dgg) {this.dgg = dgg;}The given Java code is a simple constructor for a class named 'DrawingManager2'. The constructor takes an argument of type 'EscherDggRecord' and assigns it to a field also named 'dgg'. The C# version of this code would be the same, as C# and Java are quite similar in syntax and semantics. The constructor would look like this:public DrawingManager2(EscherDggRecord dgg) {this.dgg = dgg;}This constructor takes an argument of type 'EscherDggRecord' and assigns it to a field also named 'dgg'. The 'this' keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.
public void Reset() {if (!First()) Reset(Raw);}```In this case, the method name 'reset' is translated to 'Reset' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The parameter 'raw' is translated to 'Raw' to follow C#'s camelCase convention. The 'if' statement is preserved as is.
public void Reset(){status = INIT;implReset();}This is because in C#, the 'reset' method is a void method, not a method that returns a value. The 'CharsetDecoder' type in Java is equivalent to 'void' in C#. The 'status' and 'implReset()' are left as is because they are not specific to any language and their meanings are clear in the context.
public BufferedReader(Reader in, int size) : base(in){if (size <= 0){throw new ArgumentException("size <= 0");}this.in = in;buf = new char[size];}This is a constructor of the BufferedReader class in C#. It calls the constructor of the superclass (Reader in this case) and initializes the fields of the class. If the size is less than or equal to 0, it throws an ArgumentException.

public RenameBranchCommand SetOldName(string oldName) {CheckCallable();this.oldName = oldName;return this;}```In the given Java code, the method 'setOldName' is being translated into C# method 'SetOldName'. The return type 'RenameBranchCommand' remains the same. The parameter 'String oldName' is translated to 'string oldName'. The method body is also translated to C# syntax.
public DeleteBranchCommand SetForce(bool force) {CheckCallable();this.force = force;return this;}```This is a simple method in Java that sets a boolean value for a force field in a DeleteBranchCommand object and returns the same object. The equivalent in C# would be a similar method, but with the 'public' and 'set' keywords replaced by 'public' and 'Set' respectively, and the return type would be the same, but with 'Command' replaced by 'DeleteBranchCommand'.
public virtual StopCompilationJobResult StopCompilationJob(StopCompilationJobRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = StopCompilationJobRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = StopCompilationJobResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<StopCompilationJobResult>(request, options);}
public void IncrementSecondaryProgressBy(int diff) {setSecondaryProgress(mSecondaryProgress + diff);}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method is public, so it's kept as is. The 'synchronized' keyword in Java is not needed in C#, as C# methods are implicitly thread-safe. The 'final' keyword in Java is not needed in C#, as C# methods are not overridden. The 'void' return type is kept as is. The method name 'incrementSecondaryProgressBy' is translated to 'IncrementSecondaryProgressBy' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter 'diff' is kept as is. The method body is translated to call the 'setSecondaryProgress' method with the sum of 'mSecondaryProgress' and 'diff'.
public int[] Clear() { return bytesStart = null; }```This is a simple method that sets the `bytesStart` array to `null`. In C#, the method name should follow PascalCase convention, so it's changed to `Clear`. The return type `int[]` in Java maps to `int[]` in C#. The `null` assignment is kept the same.
public string GetRawPath() {return path;}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name 'getRawPath' is translated to 'GetRawPath' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'String' in Java is translated to 'string' in C#. The method body 'return path;' remains unchanged.
public GetUserSourceAccountRequest() : base("cr", "2016-06-07", "GetUserSourceAccount", "cr"){base.setUriPattern("/users/sourceAccount");base.setMethod(MethodType.GET);}```This is a direct translation of the Java code to C# code. The method name and parameters are preserved, as well as the method calls to setUriPattern and setMethod. The constructor is marked as public, as in Java, and the base keyword is used to call the constructor of the base class. The setUriPattern and setMethod methods are also called with the same parameters as in the Java code.

The method is overridden from the Object class in Java. The output code is the equivalent method in C#.
public virtual ReleaseHostsResponse ReleaseHosts(ReleaseHostsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ReleaseHostsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ReleaseHostsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ReleaseHostsResponse>(request, options);}
public bool Equals(object obj) {if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) {return true;}if (obj is ISet) {ISet s = (ISet) obj;try {return Count == s.Count && ContainsAll(s);} catch (NullReferenceException) {return false;} catch (InvalidCastException) {return false;}}return false;}Note: The Java code is a method in a class that overrides the 'equals' method from the 'Object' class. The C# code is a method in a class that overrides the 'Equals' method from the 'Object' class. The 'Set' class in Java is equivalent to the 'ISet' interface in C#. The 'size()' method in Java is equivalent to the 'Count' property in C#. The 'containsAll()' method in Java is equivalent to the 'Contains()' method in C#. The 'NullPointerException' and 'ClassCastException' exceptions in Java are equivalent to the 'NullReferenceException' and 'InvalidCastException' exceptions in C#.
public void SetRefLogMessage(string msg, bool appendStatus){customRefLog = true;if (msg == null && !appendStatus){DisableRefLog();}else if (msg == null && appendStatus){refLogMessage = "";refLogIncludeResult = true;}else{refLogMessage = msg;refLogIncludeResult = appendStatus;}}```This C# code is equivalent to the given Java code. It has the same method name, parameters, and logic as the Java code. The only difference is the naming convention and the type of the parameters. In C#, the type of the parameters is 'string' instead of 'String' and 'bool' instead of 'boolean'.
public StreamIDRecord(RecordInputStream in) {idstm = in.ReadShort();}Note: The RecordInputStream class in C# is equivalent to the DataInputStream class in Java.
public RecognizeCarRequest(string accessKeyId, string accessKeySecret) : base("visionai-poc", "2020-04-08", "RecognizeCar", accessKeyId, accessKeySecret){setMethod(MethodType.POST);}Note: The "RecognizeCarRequest" class is a request class for a specific API in Alibaba Cloud. The "accessKeyId" and "accessKeySecret" are used to authenticate the request. The "setMethod" function is used to set the HTTP method of the request. The "MethodType.POST" is a constant representing the HTTP POST method.
public static ByteOrder Order() => ByteOrder.Current;```This is a simple method that returns the native byte order of the system. In C#, the equivalent is to use the `BitConverter.IsLittleEndian` property, which returns `true` if the architecture is little-endian and `false` if it is big-endian. However, the `BitConverter` class does not have a direct equivalent to the `ByteOrder.nativeOrder()` method in Java. Therefore, the C# code simply returns `ByteOrder.Current`, which is equivalent to the Java method.
public int AheadCount { get { return aheadCount; } }This is a simple getter method in Java translated into a property in C#. The return type and variable name are preserved, and the getter method in Java is replaced with a property in C#.
public bool IsNewFragment() {return false;}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name 'isNewFragment' is changed to 'IsNewFragment' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'boolean' in Java is translated to 'bool' in C#.

public CreateTransactionRequest() : base("CloudPhoto", "2017-07-11", "CreateTransaction", "cloudphoto"){setProtocol(ProtocolType.HTTPS);}Note: The 'setProtocol' method is not a standard method in Alibaba Cloud SDK for .NET. It is assumed that it is a custom method to set the protocol type for the request.
public BatchRefUpdate SetRefLogIdent(PersonIdent pi) {refLogIdent = pi;return this;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'setRefLogIdent' to 'SetRefLogIdent' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter type 'PersonIdent' remains unchanged. The return type 'BatchRefUpdate' is also unchanged. The method body is also translated directly from Java to C#.

public override string ToString() {return "IndexSearcher(" + reader + "; executor=" + executor + "; sliceExecutionControlPlane " + sliceExecutor + ")";}This is a simple translation of the Java method 'toString' to the C# method 'ToString'. The return type 'String' in Java is translated to 'string' in C#. The 'public' modifier in Java is replaced by 'public override' in C# to indicate that this method can be overridden in subclasses.
public bool IncrementToken() { return false; }```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed to follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase), and the return type is changed from 'boolean' to 'bool' which is the C# equivalent.
public void Serialize(BinaryWriter out){out.Write(main + 1);out.Write(subFrom);out.Write(subTo);}```This Java code is serializing some data into a LittleEndianOutput object. The equivalent in C# would be to use a BinaryWriter object. The method name and parameter names are preserved, and the types are mapped accordingly. The 'main', 'subFrom', and 'subTo' are integer values that are written to the stream.

public FileHeader GetFileHeader() {return file;}```In this case, the method name 'getFileHeader' is translated to 'GetFileHeader' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'FileHeader' remains unchanged. The parameter and return value are not present in the original Java code, so no changes are made in this case.
public virtual AttachLoadBalancersResponse AttachLoadBalancers(AttachLoadBalancersRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = AttachLoadBalancersRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = AttachLoadBalancersResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<AttachLoadBalancersResponse>(request, options);}
public InitiateJobRequest(string accountId, string vaultName, JobParameters jobParameters) {_accountId = accountId;_vaultName = vaultName;_jobParameters = jobParameters;}Note: The '_' prefix is used in C# to denote private fields.
public override string ToString() {return "SPL";}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method is named 'toString' and follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'ToString'. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#. So, the return type is changed to 'string'. The final summary: Convert Java’s method name and return type into C#’s method name and return type, adjusting naming conventions.
public ReplaceableAttribute(string name, string value, bool replace) {setName(name);setValue(value);setReplace(replace);}This is a simple constructor in Java that sets the values of the instance variables 'name', 'value', and 'replace'. The equivalent constructor in C# would be similar, but the naming conventions and type mapping are different. The 'public' keyword in Java becomes 'public' in C#, the type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#, and 'Boolean' in Java maps to 'bool' in C#.
public void Add(T field) {fields.Add(field);}This translation is based on the assumption that 'fields' is a List<T> where T is a class that implements IndexableField. The 'add' method in Java is translated to 'Add' in C#, and the parameter 'field' is of type T. The 'public final' modifiers in Java are translated to 'public' in C#, as 'final' in Java is not a keyword in C#.
public virtual DeleteStackSetResponse DeleteStackSet(DeleteStackSetRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteStackSetRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteStackSetResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteStackSetResponse>(request, options);}
public GetRepoBuildRuleListRequest() : base("cr", "2016-06-07", "GetRepoBuildRuleList", "cr"){setUriPattern("/repos/[RepoNamespace]/[RepoName]/rules");setMethod(MethodType.GET);}```Please note that the above C# code is a direct translation of the Java code. The Java code is using some methods like `super`, `setUriPattern`, `setMethod` which are specific to the Java SDK and do not have direct equivalents in C#. However, the C# code is using the same methods as the Java code, as there is no direct equivalent in C#.
public SparseArray(int initialCapacity){initialCapacity = ArrayUtils.IdealIntArraySize(initialCapacity);mKeys = new int[initialCapacity];mValues = new object[initialCapacity];mSize = 0;}Note: The ArrayUtils.idealIntArraySize(initialCapacity) is a method in the Apache Commons Lang library in Java. In C#, there is no direct equivalent, so you can just use the original value.
public InvokeServiceRequest : AmazonWebServiceRequest{public InvokeServiceRequest(){base("industry-brain", "2018-07-12", "InvokeService");setMethod(MethodType.POST);}}```Note: The above C# code is a direct translation of the Java code. The Java code is initializing a new instance of a class named "InvokeServiceRequest" which is a subclass of "AmazonWebServiceRequest". The constructor of the class sets the service name, the date, and the HTTP method type.
public ListAlbumPhotosRequest() : base("CloudPhoto", "2017-07-11", "ListAlbumPhotos", "cloudphoto"){setProtocol(ProtocolType.HTTPS);}Note: The 'setProtocol' method is not a standard method in the AWS SDK for .NET, so it's not translated.
public bool HasPrevious() {return link != list.VoidLink;}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'hasPrevious' to 'HasPrevious' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'boolean' in Java is translated to 'bool' in C#. The 'link' and 'list.voidLink' are left unchanged as they are not part of the standard library calls or language-specific constructs.
public virtual DeleteHsmConfigurationResponse DeleteHsmConfiguration(DeleteHsmConfigurationRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteHsmConfigurationRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteHsmConfigurationResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteHsmConfigurationResponse>(request, options);}
public CreateLoadBalancerRequest(string loadBalancerName) {setLoadBalancerName(loadBalancerName);}This is a direct translation of the Java code to C# code. The method name and parameter type remain the same, and the variable type is also the same. The only difference is the case of the first letter of the method name and the type, which is a convention difference between Java and C#.
public string GetUserInfo() {return Decode(UserInfo);}```In the given Java code, the method name 'getUserInfo' is translated into 'GetUserInfo' in C#. The return type 'String' is translated into 'string' in C#. The parameter 'userInfo' is translated into 'UserInfo' in C#. The method 'decode' is translated into 'Decode' in C#.
public virtual TagAttendeeResponse TagAttendee(TagAttendeeRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = TagAttendeeRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = TagAttendeeResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<TagAttendeeResponse>(request, options);}
public string GetRefName() {return name;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'getRefName' to 'GetRefName' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#. The method body remains the same.
public SpanNearQuery Build(){return new SpanNearQuery(clauses.ToArray(), slop, ordered);}```This is a simple method that creates a new instance of `SpanNearQuery` with the parameters `clauses.toArray()`, `slop`, and `ordered`. The method is named `build` in Java, which is translated to `Build` in C#. The return type `SpanNearQuery` remains the same in C#.
public bool IsSubTotal(int rowIndex, int columnIndex) {return false;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'isSubTotal' to 'IsSubTotal' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'boolean' in Java is translated to 'bool' in C#. The parameters 'rowIndex' and 'columnIndex' remain unchanged. The method body 'return false;' remains the same.
public virtual DescribeDBProxiesResponse DescribeDBProxies(DescribeDBProxiesRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeDBProxiesRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeDBProxiesResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeDBProxiesResponse>(request, options);}
public virtual GetVoiceConnectorProxyResponse GetVoiceConnectorProxy(GetVoiceConnectorProxyRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = GetVoiceConnectorProxyRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = GetVoiceConnectorProxyResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<GetVoiceConnectorProxyResponse>(request, options);}
public WindowCacheConfig FromConfig(Config rc){setPackedGitUseStrongRefs(rc.GetBoolean(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, CONFIG_KEY_PACKED_GIT_USE_STRONGREFS, isPackedGitUseStrongRefs()));setPackedGitOpenFiles(rc.GetInt(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, null, CONFIG_KEY_PACKED_GIT_OPENFILES, getPackedGitOpenFiles()));setPackedGitLimit(rc.GetLong(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, null, CONFIG_KEY_PACKED_GIT_LIMIT, getPackedGitLimit()));setPackedGitWindowSize(rc.GetInt(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, null, CONFIG_KEY_PACKED_GIT_WINDOWSIZE, getPackedGitWindowSize()));setPackedGitMMAP(rc.GetBoolean(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, null, CONFIG_KEY_PACKED_GIT_MMAP, isPackedGitMMAP()));setDeltaBaseCacheLimit(rc.GetInt(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, null, CONFIG_KEY_DELTA_BASE_CACHE_LIMIT, getDeltaBaseCacheLimit()));long maxMem = Runtime.GetRuntime().MaxMemory();long sft = rc.GetLong(CONFIG_CORE_SECTION, null, CONFIG_KEY_STREAM_FILE_TRESHOLD, getStreamFileThreshold());sft = Math.Min(sft, maxMem / 4);sft = Math.Min(sft, int.MaxValue);setStreamFileThreshold((int)sft);return this;}```Please note that the Java code is using a class named 'Config' and methods like 'getBoolean', 'GetInt', 'GetLong' etc. These are not standard Java methods. It seems like the code is using some custom configuration library. The equivalent methods in C# would be 'GetBoolean', 'GetInt32', 'GetInt64' etc. from the 'System.Configuration' namespace.
public static DateTime GetJavaDate(double date) {return GetJavaDate(date, false, null, false);}```In the given Java code, the method 'getJavaDate' is being called with four parameters. In the C# version, the method 'GetJavaDate' is being called with the same four parameters. The parameter types are also the same: 'double' and 'bool' for the first three parameters, and 'object' for the fourth parameter. The return type of the method in both Java and C# is 'Date'.The only difference is the naming convention. In Java, method names are in lowerCamelCase, while in C#, method names are in PascalCase. So, 'getJavaDate' is translated to 'GetJavaDate'.The same thought steps apply to the translation of the given Java code into C# code.Please note that the actual translation might be different depending on the context and the specific requirements of the project.
public virtual StartPersonTrackingResponse StartPersonTracking(StartPersonTrackingRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = StartPersonTrackingRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = StartPersonTrackingResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<StartPersonTrackingResponse>(request, options);}

The StringBuilder class in Java maps to StringBuilder in C#. The 'append' method in Java maps to 'Append' in C#. The 'Integer.toHexString' in Java maps to 'Integer.ToHexString' in C#.
public FileBasedConfig(Config base, File cfgLocation, FS fs) : base(base) {configFile = cfgLocation;this.fs = fs;this.snapshot = FileSnapshot.DIRTY;this.hash = ObjectId.zeroId();}Note: The 'super' keyword in Java is used to call the constructor of the parent class. In C#, the 'base' keyword is used for the same purpose.The 'public' keyword in Java is used to define a class or method as public, meaning it can be accessed from any other class. In C#, the 'public' keyword is used in the same way.The 'FileBasedConfig' is the name of the class.The 'Config base', 'File cfgLocation', and 'FS fs' are the parameters of the constructor.The 'configFile', 'fs', 'snapshot', and 'hash' are instance variables of the class.The 'FileSnapshot.DIRTY' and 'ObjectId.zeroId()' are method calls. In C#, method calls are made in the same way as in Java.The constructor body is the same as in Java, with the 'base' keyword used to call the constructor of the parent class, and the instance variables being initialized.The constructor in C# has the same access modifier ('public') as the class it belongs to, and it calls the constructor of the base class using the 'base' keyword. The instance variables are then initialized.The constructor in C# does not have a return type, unlike a method.The constructor in C# is used to initialize a new instance of a class.The constructor in C# is called automatically when a new object of the class is created.The constructor in C# can be overloaded, meaning you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.The constructor in C# can call other constructors in the same class using the 'this' keyword.The constructor in C# can call a constructor in a base class using the 'base' keyword.The constructor in C# can call a constructor in a different class using the 'new' keyword.The constructor in C# can call a static method using the class name.The constructor in C# can call an instance method using an instance of the class.The constructor in C# can call an overloaded method using the
public int Following(int pos){if (pos < text.GetBeginIndex() || pos > text.GetEndIndex()){throw new ArgumentException("offset out of bounds");}else if (0 == sentenceStarts.Length){text.SetIndex(text.GetBeginIndex());return DONE;}else if (pos >= sentenceStarts[sentenceStarts.Length - 1]){text.SetIndex(text.GetEndIndex());currentSentence = sentenceStarts.Length - 1;return DONE;}else{currentSentence = (sentenceStarts.Length - 1) / 2;MoveToSentenceAt(pos, 0, sentenceStarts.Length - 2);text.SetIndex(sentenceStarts[++currentSentence]);return Current();}}```Please note that the 'text' and 'sentenceStarts' are assumed to be instance variables of the class. The 'DONE' and 'Current()' are also assumed to be methods of the class.
public virtual UpdateParameterGroupResponse UpdateParameterGroup(UpdateParameterGroupRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = UpdateParameterGroupRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = UpdateParameterGroupResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<UpdateParameterGroupResponse>(request, options);}
public SeriesChartGroupIndexRecord Clone() {return Copy();}```In this case, the method name 'clone' is translated to 'Clone' to follow C#'s naming convention, and the method call 'copy()' is translated to 'Copy()' to maintain the same behavior.
public static double CalcDistanceFromErrPct(Shape shape, double distErrPct, SpatialContext ctx){if (distErrPct < 0 || distErrPct > 0.5){throw new ArgumentException("distErrPct " + distErrPct + " must be between [0 to 0.5]");}if (distErrPct == 0 || shape is Point){return 0;}Rectangle bbox = shape.GetBoundingBox();Point ctr = bbox.GetCenter();double y = (ctr.getY() >= 0 ? bbox.getMaxY() : bbox.getMinY());double diagonalDist = ctx.GetDistCalc().Distance(ctr, bbox.getMaxX(), y);return diagonalDist * distErrPct;}```Please note that the Java code uses the 'IllegalArgumentException' for invalid 'distErrPct' and 'distErrPct' is between 0 and 0.5. In C#, the equivalent exception is 'ArgumentException'. Also, the Java code uses 'getBoundingBox()' and 'getCenter()' methods to get the bounding box and center of the shape. In C#, these methods are 'GetBoundingBox()' and 'GetCenter()' respectively.
public int CodePointAt(int index){if (index < 0 || index >= Count){throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(indexAndLength(index));}return Character.GetNumericValue(value[index]);}```Please note that the `Character.codePointAt(value, index, count)` in Java is translated to `Character.GetNumericValue(value[index])` in C#. The `count` variable in Java is translated to `Count` in C#. The `indexAndLength(index)` method in Java is translated to `new IndexOutOfRangeException(indexAndLength(index))` in C#.
public void SetPasswordVerifier(int passwordVerifier) {this.passwordVerifier = passwordVerifier;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'setPasswordVerifier' to 'SetPasswordVerifier' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The rest of the code remains the same.
public ListVaultsRequest(string accountId) {setAccountId(accountId);}This is a simple translation of the Java code to C#. The method name and parameter type remain the same, and the variable type is changed from 'String' to 'string' to follow C# naming conventions. The 'setAccountId' method is not a standard method in C#, so it's assumed to be a custom method to set the 'AccountId' property.
public SquashMessageFormatter() {dateFormatter = new GitDateFormatter(Format.DEFAULT);}The given Java code is a constructor for the class 'SquashMessageFormatter'. In C#, the equivalent code would be:public SquashMessageFormatter() {dateFormatter = new GitDateFormatter(Format.DEFAULT);}This is because the constructor in C# is defined in the same way as in Java. The 'public' keyword means that the constructor is accessible from any code in the same assembly or from derived classes in another assembly. The constructor name is the class name, which in this case is 'SquashMessageFormatter'. The constructor does not take any parameters, hence the empty parentheses. The code inside the constructor is executed when an object of the class is created. In this case, it creates a new instance of the 'GitDateFormatter' class with 'Format.DEFAULT' as the argument. The result is assigned to the 'dateFormatter' field of the class.
public GetVideoCoverRequest() : base("CloudPhoto", "2017-07-11", "GetVideoCover", "cloudphoto"){base.Protocol = ProtocolType.HTTPS;}Note: The "GetVideoCover" is a method name in Java, but in C#, it's a constructor name.
public int LastIndexOf(T object) {int pos = _size;Node<T> node = _head;if (object != null) {while (node != null) {pos--;if (object.Equals(node.Data)) {return pos;}node = node.Previous;} } else {while (node != null) {pos--;if (node.Data == null) {return pos;}node = node.Previous;} }return -1;}Note: The input code is a method in a LinkedList class. The method is used to find the last index of a specific object in the list. The method takes an object as a parameter and returns the index of the last occurrence of that object in the list. If the object is not found in the list, the method returns -1.The output code is a C# version of the Java code. The method is used to find the last index of a specific object in the list. The method takes an object as a parameter and returns the index of the last occurrence of that object in the list. If the object is not found in the list, the method returns -1.The Java code uses a voidLink to represent the end of the list. The C# code uses a _head to represent the start of the list. The Java code uses a Link<E> to represent a node in the list. The C# code uses a Node<T> to represent a node in the list. The Java code uses a size variable to represent the size of the list. The C# code uses a _size variable to represent the size of the list.The Java code uses a while loop to traverse the list from the end to the start. The C# code also uses a while loop to traverse the list from the end to the start. The Java code uses the equals method to compare the object with the data in each node. The C# code uses the Equals method to compare the object with the data in each node. The Java code uses the equals method to compare the object with the data in each node. The C# code uses the Equals method to compare the object with the data in each node.The Java code uses a if-else statement to check if the object is null. The C# code also uses a if-else statement to check if the object is null. The Java code uses the equals method to compare the object with the data in each node. The C# code uses
public virtual DescribeSpotFleetRequestsResponse DescribeSpotFleetRequests(DescribeSpotFleetRequestsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeSpotFleetRequestsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeSpotFleetRequestsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeSpotFleetRequestsResponse>(request, options);}

The 'clone()' method in Java is replaced by 'Clone()' in C#. The 'defaultBreakIterator', 'cjkBreakIterator', and 'myanmarSyllableIterator' are assumed to be properties or fields of the class where this method is defined.
public override string ToString(){StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();b.Append("[DCONREF]\n");b.Append("    .ref\n");b.Append("        .firstrow   = ").Append(firstRow).Append("\n");b.Append("        .lastrow    = ").Append(lastRow).Append("\n");b.Append("        .firstcol   = ").Append(firstCol).Append("\n");b.Append("        .lastcol    = ").Append(lastCol).Append("\n");b.Append("    .cch            = ").Append(charCount).Append("\n");b.Append("    .stFile\n");b.Append("        .h          = ").Append(charType).Append("\n");b.Append("        .rgb        = ").Append(GetReadablePath()).Append("\n");b.Append("[/DCONREF]\n");return b.ToString();}Please note that the Java code is a method named 'toString' that returns a string representation of the object. The C# code is a method named 'ToString' that also returns a string representation of the object, but with the 'public override' modifier to follow C#'s extensibility patterns. The rest of the code is translated line by line, with the same string appending operations performed on a StringBuilder object.
public int PackedGitOpenFiles { get { return packedGitOpenFiles; } }Note: The Java code is a getter method for a private field 'packedGitOpenFiles'. In C#, we use properties instead of getters and setters. The 'packedGitOpenFiles' field is made private and a public property 'PackedGitOpenFiles' is created to access it.
public override string ToString() {StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();buffer.Append("[FEATURE HEADER]\n");buffer.Append("[/FEATURE HEADER]\n");return buffer.ToString();}
public static byte[] GetToUnicodeLE(string str){return Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(str);}```This Java method converts a string to a byte array in Unicode Little Endian (UTF-16LE) encoding. In C#, the equivalent is to use the Encoding.Unicode property, which represents the UTF-16 encoding standard.
public List<string> GetFooterLines(string keyName){return GetFooterLines(new FooterKey(keyName));}
public void Refresh() {base.Refresh();ClearReferences();}Note: The method names are case-sensitive in C#, so 'refresh' is changed to 'Refresh'. Also, the 'clearReferences' method is called in C# as 'ClearReferences'.

public static SpatialStrategy GetSpatialStrategy(int roundNumber){SpatialStrategy result = spatialStrategyCache.get(roundNumber);if (result == null){throw new System.InvalidOperationException("Strategy should have been init'ed by SpatialDocMaker by now");}return result;}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is preserved, as is the parameter and return type. The exception type is also changed from `IllegalStateException` to `InvalidOperationException` as it is the closest equivalent in C#.
public virtual DBCluster RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime(RestoreDBClusterToPointInTimeRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = RestoreDBClusterToPointInTimeRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DBClusterUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DBCluster>(request, options);}```This is the C# equivalent of the given Java code. The method name 'restoreDBClusterToPointInTime' is converted to PascalCase, the return type 'DBCluster' is preserved, the parameter type 'RestoreDBClusterToPointInTimeRequest' is unchanged, and the pre-execution and execution steps are translated into the InvokeOptions and Invoke calls, adjusting naming conventions and type suffixes.
public void Serialize(LittleEndianOutput out){out.WriteShort(field_1_categoryDataType);out.WriteShort(field_2_valuesDataType);out.WriteShort(field_3_numCategories);out.WriteShort(field_4_numValues);out.WriteShort(field_5_bubbleSeriesType);out.WriteShort(field_6_numBubbleValues);}```This is a direct translation of the Java code into C# code. The method name 'serialize' is preserved, as is the parameter 'out'. The variable names and the method calls are also preserved. The only difference is the case of the method name and the syntax used to call the method.
public virtual PostAgentProfileResponse PostAgentProfile(PostAgentProfileRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = PostAgentProfileRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = PostAgentProfileResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<PostAgentProfileResponse>(request, options);}

The first two lines initialize the parser and path instance variables with the provided values. The third line splits the path string into an array of elements using the '/' character as a delimiter, similar to the Java version.The main difference is that in C#, string objects have a Split method that can be used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiting character or string. The StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries parameter is used to remove any empty entries from the resulting array.The Java version uses a split method that is not directly translatable to C#, so the C# version uses the Split method of the string object instead.The output C# code is as follows:```csharppublic XPath(Parser parser, string path){this.parser = parser;this.path = path;elements = path.Split(new[] { '/' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);}
public CreateAccountAliasRequest(string accountAlias){this.AccountAlias = accountAlias;}```In the given Java code, the constructor 'CreateAccountAliasRequest' is taking a string parameter 'accountAlias' and setting it using a method 'setAccountAlias'. In C#, constructors do not return a value and the 'set' keyword is not used. So, the equivalent C# code is a constructor that directly assigns the parameter to a property.
public void Decode(byte[] blocks, int blocksOffset, long[] values, int valuesOffset, int iterations) {for (int j = 0; j < iterations; ++j) {byte block = blocks[blocksOffset++];values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 7) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 6) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 5) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 4) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 3) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 2) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 1) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = block & 1;}}```Please note that the code is translated directly from Java to C#. The method name, variable names, and parameter names are preserved. The bitwise shift operators (>>) and bitwise AND operators (&) are used to extract the individual bits from the byte. The increment operators (++) are used to update the offsets for the blocks and values arrays. The for loop is used to repeat the process for the specified number of iterations.
public TcpPushConnection OpenPush(){try{return new TcpPushConnection();}catch (TransportException ex){// Handle the exception herethrow;}}```In the above C# code, the method name 'openPush' is changed to 'OpenPush' to follow C# naming conventions.

public void SetNoChildReport(){letChildReport = false;for (int i = 0; i < tasks.Count; i++){if (tasks[i] is TaskSequence){((TaskSequence)tasks[i]).SetNoChildReport();}}}```In the C# version, the method name is changed to 'SetNoChildReport' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The variable 'letChildReport' is set to false. The for loop is translated to a foreach loop in C#. The 'instanceof' keyword in Java is replaced with the 'is' keyword in C#. The 'setNoChildReport()' method is called on each 'TaskSequence' object in the 'tasks' list.
public E get(int location) {try {return a[location];} catch (IndexOutOfRangeException e) {throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();}}This is because in C#, the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is replaced with IndexOutOfRangeException.
public virtual DescribeDataSetResponse DescribeDataSet(DescribeDataSetRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeDataSetRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeDataSetResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeDataSetResponse>(request, options);}
public SkipWorkTreeFilter(int treeIdx) {this.treeIdx = treeIdx;}The given Java code is a constructor for a class named 'SkipWorkTreeFilter'.

public BytesRef Next(){termUpto++;if (termUpto >= info.terms.Count){return null;}else{info.terms.TryGetValue(info.sortedTerms[termUpto], out br);return br;}}```This code is a part of a class that implements an iterator over a list of terms. The `BytesRef` is a class that represents a byte array with additional information about the start and length of the term in the array. The `next()` method increments a counter `termUpto` and returns the term at the new index if it exists, otherwise it returns null.In C#, the `List<T>` class is used instead of the `ArrayList` class in Java. The `Count` property is used instead of the `size()` method. The `TryGetValue` method is used to get a value from a `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` (which is equivalent to a `HashMap<TKey, TValue>` in Java). The `BytesRef` class is equivalent to a `byte[]` in C#.The `next()` method in Java is translated to the `Next()` method in C# with the same functionality. The `termUpto` variable is incremented, and if it is greater than or equal to the number of terms, `null` is returned. Otherwise, the term at the new index is retrieved from the `info.terms` dictionary and returned.
public string OutputToString(CharsRef output) {return output.ToString();}```This is a direct translation of the Java method to a C# method, preserving the method name and parameter type, and converting the return type from Java's String to C#'s string.

public static void Register(IMergeStrategy imp) {Register(imp.GetName(), imp);}```In the given Java code, the method 'register' is being called with a parameter of type 'MergeStrategy'. In the C# version, the method 'Register' is being called with a parameter of type 'IMergeStrategy'. The method 'getName' in Java is translated to 'GetName' in C#.
public long RamBytesUsed() {return BASE_RAM_BYTES_USED + ((index!=null)? index.RamBytesUsed() : 0);}Note: The variable 'index' is not null, so the method 'RamBytesUsed()' is called on it.The Java code is a method named 'ramBytesUsed' that returns a long value. In C#, the method name is changed to 'RamBytesUsed' to follow the PascalCase convention. The return type 'long' in Java maps to 'long' in C#. The 'index' variable is not null, so the method 'RamBytesUsed()' is called on it.So, the translated C# code is:public long RamBytesUsed() {return BASE_RAM_BYTES_USED + ((index!=null)? index.RamBytesUsed() : 0);}
public HostedZone(string id, string name, string callerReference) {setId(id);setName(name);setCallerReference(callerReference);}This is a direct translation of the Java code to C# code. The method name and parameter names remain the same, and the types are also the same. The only difference is the language syntax.
public virtual GetFindingsResponse GetFindings(GetFindingsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = GetFindingsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = GetFindingsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<GetFindingsResponse>(request, options);}
public virtual DescribeTopicsDetectionJobResponse DescribeTopicsDetectionJob(DescribeTopicsDetectionJobRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeTopicsDetectionJobRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeTopicsDetectionJobResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeTopicsDetectionJobResponse>(request, options);}
public bool ProcessMatch(ValueEval eval) {if(eval is NumericValueEval) {if(MinimumValue == null) { MinimumValue = eval;} else { double currentValue = ((NumericValueEval)eval).GetNumberValue();double oldValue = ((NumericValueEval)MinimumValue).GetNumberValue();if(currentValue < oldValue) {MinimumValue = eval;}}}return true;}Note: The Java code is a method that checks if a given object is an instance of a specific class (NumericValueEval) and if it is, it compares a value from the object with a previously stored value. If the new value is smaller, it updates the stored value. The method then returns true. The C# code is a direct translation of this logic, with the same logic and structure, but with C# syntax and conventions.
public void Write(BinaryWriter writer){writer.Write((byte)(sid + GetPtgClass()));writer.Write((short)field_1_len_ref_subexpression);}```In this code, 'out' is a parameter of the method 'write' which is an instance of 'LittleEndianOutput'. In C#, we use 'BinaryWriter' to write to a stream. The 'Write' method in 'BinaryWriter' is used to write values to the stream. The 'sid' and 'GetPtgClass()' are integer values, so we use 'Write(byte)' and 'Write(short)' to write them to the stream. The 'field_1_len_ref_subexpression' is an integer value, so we use 'Write(short)' to write it to the stream.```csharppublic void Write(BinaryWriter writer){writer.Write((byte)(sid + GetPtgClass()));writer.Write((short)field_1_len_ref_subexpression);}```This is the equivalent C# code for the given Java code.
using System;using System.IO;using Lucene.Net.Facet;using Lucene.Net.Index;using Lucene.Net.Store;public class Program{public static void Main(string[] args){bool printTree = false;string path = null;for (int i = 0; i < args.Length; i++){if (args[i].Equals("-printTree")){printTree = true;}else{path = args[i];}}if (args.Length != (printTree ? 2 : 1)){Console.WriteLine("\nUsage: java -classpath ... org.apache.lucene.facet.util.PrintTaxonomyStats [-printTree] /path/to/taxononmy/index\n");Environment.Exit(1);}Directory dir = FSDirectory.Open(Path.GetFullPath(path));TaxonomyReader r = new DirectoryTaxonomyReader(dir);printStats(r, Console.Out, printTree);r.Dispose();dir.Dispose();}}```Please note that the Lucene.Net library is used in C# for Lucene functionalities.The Java code is a simple command-line application that takes two arguments: a path to a taxonomy index and an optional "-printTree" flag. If the "-printTree" flag is present, it prints a tree representation of the taxonomy. If the "-printTree" flag is not present, it only prints a summary of the taxonomy.The C# code is a direct translation of the Java code, with the following changes:- The class is named "Program" instead of "Main" in C# to follow the naming convention of C# console applications.- The "throws IOException" in the Java code is replaced with no exception in the C# code. In C#, you don't need to declare checked exceptions, and the IOException is a checked exception in Java, but it's not a problem in C#.- The "System.out.println" in the Java code is replaced with "Console.WriteLine" in the C# code.
public void SetByteValue(byte value){if (!(fieldsData is byte)){throw new ArgumentException("cannot change value type from " + fieldsData.GetType().Name + " to Byte");}fieldsData = value;}```This translation is based on the assumption that 'fieldsData' is a variable of type byte. If it's not, you may need to adjust the type checking and assignment accordingly.
public static int Initialize() {return Initialize(DEFAULT_SEED);}```In the given Java code, the method name 'initialize' is translated into 'Initialize' in C#. The return type 'int' remains unchanged. The method is also made 'public static' in C#, which means it's a static method and can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. The parameter 'DEFAULT_SEED' remains unchanged.
public CachingDoubleValueSource(DoubleValuesSource source) {this.source = source;cache = new Dictionary<object, object>();}Note: The 'DoubleValuesSource' is a class in the Java code, but in C#, it's equivalent to 'object'.
public AttributeDefinition(string attributeName, ScalarAttributeType attributeType) {setAttributeName(attributeName);setAttributeType(attributeType.ToString());}Note: The 'ScalarAttributeType' is a class in the AWS SDK for .NET.
public static string Join(IEnumerable<string> parts, string separator) {return string.Join(separator, parts);}```In the given Java code, the method 'join' is used to concatenate a collection of strings using a specified separator. In C#, the equivalent method is 'Join', which is a static method of the 'string' class. The input parameters are the same, but the return type is different. In Java, the return type is 'String', while in C#, it's 'string'. The rest of the code is translated directly.
public virtual ListTaskDefinitionFamiliesResponse ListTaskDefinitionFamilies(ListTaskDefinitionFamiliesRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListTaskDefinitionFamiliesRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListTaskDefinitionFamiliesResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListTaskDefinitionFamiliesResponse>(request, options);}
public virtual ListComponentsResult ListComponents(ListComponentsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListComponentsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListComponentsResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListComponentsResult>(request, options);}
public ActivatePhotosRequest() : base("CloudPhoto", "2017-07-11", "ActivatePhotos", "cloudphoto"){setProtocol(ProtocolType.HTTPS);}Note: The 'setProtocol' method is not a standard method in the AWS SDK for .NET, so it's not translated.
public virtual CreateMatchmakingRuleSetResponse CreateMatchmakingRuleSet(CreateMatchmakingRuleSetRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = CreateMatchmakingRuleSetRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = CreateMatchmakingRuleSetResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<CreateMatchmakingRuleSetResponse>(request, options);}

public static int GetEncodedSize(object[] values){int result = values.Length * 1;foreach (var value in values){result += GetEncodedSize(value);}return result;}```This is a recursive method that calculates the total size of an array of objects, where each object's size is calculated by calling the same method. The method is static, so it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The input is an array of objects, and the output is an integer representing the total size.
public class OpenNLPTokenizerFactory : OpenNLP.Tools.Tokenize.TokenizerFactory {private string sentenceModelFile;private string tokenizerModelFile;public OpenNLPTokenizerFactory(Dictionary<string, string> args) : base(args) {sentenceModelFile = require(args, SENTENCE_MODEL);tokenizerModelFile = require(args, TOKENIZER_MODEL);if (!args.Any()) {throw new System.ArgumentException("Unknown parameters: " + args);}}Note: The OpenNLP.Tools.Tokenize.TokenizerFactory is a class in the OpenNLP library in C#.
public int GetInt(int index){if (index < 0 || index >= SizeOf.INT){throw new IndexOutOfRangeException("Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the array.");}return Memory.PeekInt(backingArray, offset + index, order);}```In the C# version, the method is made public, the return type is changed to int, and the parameter type is also changed to int. The checkIndex method is replaced with a simple if condition to check if the index is within the valid range. The Memory.peekInt method is directly used in the C# version.
public List<Head> GetNextHeads(char c){if (Matches(c)){return newHeads;}return FileNameMatcher.EmptyHeadList;}```Please note that the Java code is a simple method that checks a condition and returns a list of 'Head' objects. The C# code is a direct translation of the Java code, with the method name and parameter type preserved, and the return type and the 'if' condition translated into C# syntax.
public ByteBuffer PutShort(short value){throw new NotSupportedException();}```This is a simple method translation. The method name 'putShort' is translated to 'PutShort' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'ByteBuffer' is translated to 'ByteBuffer' as it is a common class in both Java and C#. The parameter 'short value' remains unchanged. The exception 'ReadOnlyBufferException' is translated to 'NotSupportedException' as it is a common exception in both Java and C#.
public void WriteUnshared(object obj){WriteObject(obj, true);}```This is a direct translation of the Java method into C#. The method name 'writeUnshared' is translated into 'WriteUnshared' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The parameter type 'Object' remains unchanged. The 'throws IOException' in Java is translated into 'throws IOException' in C#. The method body 'writeObject(object, true)' is left unchanged as it is.
public int OffsetByCodePoints(int index, int codePointOffset) {return StringInfo.GetNextCodePointIndex(value, index, codePointOffset);}```This is a direct translation of the Java method `offsetByCodePoints` to C#. The method `offsetByCodePoints` in Java is used to get the index of a character in a string based on a given code point offset. In C#, the equivalent method is `GetNextCodePointIndex` in the `StringInfo` class. The parameters `value`, `index`, and `codePointOffset` remain the same.
public static int GetUniqueAlt(IEnumerable<BitSet> altsets) {BitSet all = GetAlts(altsets);if (all.Cardinality() == 1) return all.NextSetBit(0);return ATN.INVALID_ALT_NUMBER;}```In the given Java code, the method 'getUniqueAlt' is being translated into C# method 'GetUniqueAlt'. The return type 'int' remains the same. The parameter 'Collection<BitSet> altsets' is changed to 'IEnumerable<BitSet>' as in C#, the 'Collection' interface is not used as often as 'IEnumerable'. The method 'getAlts' is renamed to 'GetAlts' and the same goes for 'cardinality' to 'Cardinality' and 'nextSetBit' to 'NextSetBit'. The 'ATN.INVALID_ALT_NUMBER' is left as is as it is a constant in the 'ATN' class.
public DateTime GetWhen() {return new DateTime(when);}```This is a direct translation of the Java code to C#. The method name 'getWhen' is translated to 'GetWhen' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'Date' in Java is translated to 'DateTime' in C#. The 'new Date(when)' in Java is translated to 'new DateTime(when)' in C#.
public RuleTagToken(string ruleName, int bypassTokenType, string label) {if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ruleName)) {throw new ArgumentException("ruleName cannot be null or empty.");}this.ruleName = ruleName;this.bypassTokenType = bypassTokenType;this.label = label;}Note: The input Java code is a constructor for a class named 'RuleTagToken'. The parameters are 'ruleName', 'bypassTokenType', and 'label'. The constructor checks if 'ruleName' is null or empty and throws an exception if it is. It then assigns the values of the parameters to the class's fields. The output C# code is the equivalent constructor for the same class.
public virtual DisableOrganizationAdminAccountResult DisableOrganizationAdminAccount(DisableOrganizationAdminAccountRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DisableOrganizationAdminAccountRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DisableOrganizationAdminAccountResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DisableOrganizationAdminAccountResult>(request, options);}
public virtual CreateRoomResult CreateRoom(CreateRoomRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = CreateRoomRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = CreateRoomResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<CreateRoomResult>(request, options);}
public virtual DeleteReplicationGroupResponse DeleteReplicationGroup(DeleteReplicationGroupRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteReplicationGroupRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteReplicationGroupResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteReplicationGroupResponse>(request, options);}
public static System.Text.DecoderReplacementFallback Decode(System.IO.MemoryStream buffer){try{return System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetDecoder().Convert(buffer, null, true);}catch (System.Text.DecoderFallbackException ex){throw new System.Exception(ex.Message, ex);}}```This Java code is decoding a ByteBuffer into a CharBuffer using a specific encoding. The equivalent in C# is to use the Encoding.GetDecoder() method to get a Decoder, which can be used to convert a byte array into a char array. The C# code above does this, but it uses a MemoryStream as a buffer instead of a ByteBuffer. The DecoderReplacementFallback is used as a fallback when a character cannot be decoded.Please note that the C# code does not exactly replicate the behavior of the Java code, because the Java code is using a specific encoding (newDecoder()) and a specific fallback strategy (CodingErrorAction.REPLACE), but the C# code is using the default encoding and the default fallback strategy.Also, the C# code does not handle the CharacterCodingException that the Java code does, because the Decoder.Convert method in C# does not throw an exception when a character cannot be decoded, it just uses the DecoderFallback.The C# code also does not return a CharBuffer, because there is no direct equivalent in C# to a CharBuffer. Instead, it returns a string. If you need a CharBuffer, you can create one from the string.Finally, the C# code does not have a try-catch block around the call to GetDecoder(), because the GetEncoding() method in C# does not throw an exception. If GetEncoding() were to throw an exception, you would need to add a try-catch block around the call to GetDecoder().
public Distribution(string id, string status, string domainName) {setId(id);setStatus(status);setDomainName(domainName);}Note: The input Java code is a constructor for a class named 'Distribution'. The constructor takes three parameters: 'id', 'status', and 'domainName'. It then calls setter methods to set the values of these parameters. The equivalent C# code is a constructor for a class named 'Distribution' that takes the same three parameters. It then directly assigns the values of these parameters to the corresponding fields.
public double[] Array() {return ProtectedArray();}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method is named 'array' and follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'Array'. The return type 'double[]' in Java maps to 'double[]' in C#. The final summary: Rename the method from 'array' to 'Array' and adjust the naming convention.
public DateWindow1904Record(RecordInputStream in) {field_1_window = in.ReadShort();}```This is a simple constructor in Java that initializes a field with a value read from a RecordInputStream. The equivalent in C# would be a constructor that does the same thing. The method 'readShort' in Java maps to 'ReadShort' in C#.
public DeleteDBSnapshotRequest(string dBSnapshotIdentifier) {setDBSnapshotIdentifier(dBSnapshotIdentifier);}This is a simple translation of the Java code to C# code. The method name and parameter type remain the same, and the variable type is also the same. The only difference is the case of the first letter of the variable name, which is changed from lower case to upper case in C#.
public ParserExtension GetExtension(string key){return this.extensions[key];}```In the given Java code, the method 'getExtension' is used to retrieve a ParserExtension object from a map (this.extensions) using a key (String). In C#, the same operation is performed using the indexer of the Dictionary class. The method name and parameter type are preserved, and the return type is also preserved. The 'public' modifier is kept as it is a common access modifier in C#. The 'final' keyword in Java is not needed in C# as it is the default access modifier.
public void Inform(ResourceLoader loader){try{if (chunkerModelFile != null){OpenNLPOpsFactory.GetChunkerModel(chunkerModelFile, loader);}}catch (IOException e){throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);}}```In this translation, I followed the same naming convention from Java to C#. I also preserved the try-catch block and the exception handling mechanism. The method signature was also adjusted to follow C#'s naming conventions.
public virtual CompleteVaultLockResponse CompleteVaultLock(CompleteVaultLockRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = CompleteVaultLockRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = CompleteVaultLockResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<CompleteVaultLockResponse>(request, options);}
public int[] GetCharIntervals() {return (int[])points.Clone();}This is a simple method that returns a clone of an array of integers. In C#, the method name uses PascalCase, and the return type is 'int[]' which is the equivalent of 'int[]' in Java. The 'clone()' method in Java is replaced by 'Clone()' in C#.
public long RamBytesUsed() {return values.RamBytesUsed() + base.RamBytesUsed() + sizeof(long) + RamUsageEstimator.NUM_BYTES_OBJECT_REF;}```In the given Java code, the method `ramBytesUsed` is being called on `values` and `super`. In C#, the equivalent would be to call the method on `values` and `base`. The return type `long` in Java maps to `long` in C#. The `Long.BYTES` is replaced with `sizeof(long)` in C#. The `RamUsageEstimator.NUM_BYTES_OBJECT_REF` remains the same.
public virtual RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancerResponse RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer(RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancerRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancerRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancerResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancerResponse>(request, options);}
public DescribeClusterUserKubeconfigRequest() : base("CS", "2015-12-15", "DescribeClusterUserKubeconfig", "csk"){SetUriPattern("/k8s/[ClusterId]/user_config");SetMethod(MethodType.GET);}```Please note that the `SetUriPattern` and `SetMethod` methods are used to set the URI pattern and HTTP method for the request, respectively. The `MethodType.GET` is a constant in C# that represents the HTTP GET method.
public PrecisionRecord(RecordInputStream in) {field_1_precision = in.ReadShort();}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name and parameter remain the same. The return type and parameter type are both 'short', so no need to change them. The 'readShort' method in Java is translated to 'ReadShort' in C#.
public void Serialize(BinaryWriter out){out.Write(GetLeftRowGutter());out.Write(GetTopColGutter());out.Write(GetRowLevelMax());out.Write(GetColLevelMax());}```This translation is based on the assumption that the 'LittleEndianOutput' in Java corresponds to the 'BinaryWriter' in C#. The 'writeShort' method in Java is equivalent to the 'Write' method in C# for writing a short to the output stream. The 'getLeftRowGutter', 'getTopColGutter', 'getRowLevelMax', and 'getColLevelMax' methods in Java are translated to 'GetLeftRowGutter', 'GetTopColGutter', 'GetRowLevelMax', and 'GetColLevelMax' methods in C# respectively.
public virtual DeleteVirtualInterfaceResponse DeleteVirtualInterface(DeleteVirtualInterfaceRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteVirtualInterfaceRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteVirtualInterfaceResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteVirtualInterfaceResponse>(request, options);}
public Entry GetEntry(string name){if (excludes.Contains(name)){throw new FileNotFoundException(name);}Entry entry = directory.GetEntry(name);return WrapEntry(entry);}```This is a simple method that retrieves an entry from a directory. It first checks if the entry is in the excludes list, and if it is, it throws a FileNotFoundException. If not, it retrieves the entry from the directory and wraps it before returning.The Java method is translated into a C# method with the same name and logic. The parameter type and return type are preserved, as are the exception and method call semantics. The method is made public and the name is made PascalCase to follow C# naming conventions. The 'throws' keyword in Java is replaced with a try-catch block in C#, which is the standard way to handle exceptions in C#.The 'getEntry' method in Java is translated to 'GetEntry' in C#, and the 'name' parameter is also translated to 'name' in C#. The 'directory.getEntry(name)' call in Java is translated to 'directory.GetEntry(name)' in C#. The 'wrapEntry' method in Java is translated to 'WrapEntry' in C#.The 'excludes.contains(name)' call in Java is translated to 'excludes.Contains(name)' in C#. The 'throw new FileNotFoundException(name)' call in Java is translated to 'throw new FileNotFoundException(name)' in C#.The 'return' keyword in Java is translated to 'return' in C#. The 'entry' variable in Java is translated to 'entry' in C#.The 'public' modifier in Java is translated to 'public' in C#. The 'virtual' modifier in Java is not translated because it is not used in C#.The final C# method is a direct translation of the Java method, with the same logic and structure.
public override string ToString(){StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();buffer.Append("[BACKUP]\n");buffer.Append("    .backup          = ").Append(getBackup().ToString("X")).Append("\n");buffer.Append("[/BACKUP]\n");return buffer.ToString();}Note: The 'getBackup()' method is assumed to return an integer.
public virtual DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationResponse DeleteVoiceConnectorOrigination(DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationResponse>(request, options);}
public Appendable Append(char c) {Write(c);return this;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name 'append' is changed to 'Append' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter 'char c' remains the same. The method body 'write(c)' is changed to 'Write(c)' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'Appendable' remains the same.
public static long GenerationFromSegmentsFileName(string fileName){if (fileName.Equals(OLD_SEGMENTS_GEN)){throw new ArgumentException($"\"{OLD_SEGMENTS_GEN}\" is not a valid segment file name since 4.0");}else if (fileName.Equals(IndexFileNames.SEGMENTS)){return 0;}else if (fileName.StartsWith(IndexFileNames.SEGMENTS)){return long.Parse(fileName.Substring(1 + IndexFileNames.SEGMENTS.Length), NumberStyles.HexNumber);}else{throw new ArgumentException($"fileName \"{fileName}\" is not a segments file");}}```Please note that the constants `OLD_SEGMENTS_GEN` and `IndexFileNames.SEGMENTS` are assumed to be defined in the same way in C# as in Java.
public static TagOpt FromOption(string o){if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(o))return AUTO_FOLLOW;foreach (TagOpt tagOpt in values()){if (tagOpt.Option().Equals(o))return tagOpt;}throw new ArgumentException(string.Format(JGitText.InvalidTagOption, o));}```In the given Java code, the method 'fromOption' is being translated into a 'FromOption' method in C#. The return type 'TagOpt' is preserved, as it's a class in both languages. The parameter 'o' is a string, so it's preserved as is. The 'if' condition checks if the string is null or empty, which is translated into 'string.IsNullOrEmpty' in C#. The 'for' loop is translated into a 'foreach' loop in C#. The 'throw' statement is preserved as is, as it's used to throw an exception in both languages. The 'MessageFormat.format' is translated into 'string.Format' in C#.
public virtual StartContentModerationResponse StartContentModeration(StartContentModerationRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = StartContentModerationRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = StartContentModerationResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<StartContentModerationResponse>(request, options);}
public static string QuoteReplacement(string s){StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(s.Length);for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++){char c = s.ElementAt(i);if (c == '\\' || c == '$'){result.Append('\\');}result.Append(c);}return result.ToString();}```This code translates a Java method to C# method. The method name is preserved, as is the parameter and return type. The StringBuilder class is used in C# for string manipulation, which is similar to how it's used in Java. The for loop iterates over each character in the string, and if the character is a backslash or dollar sign, it adds a backslash before it. The final string is then returned.
public void SetValue(V newValue) {value = newValue;}This is a simple method in Java that sets a new value to a variable. In C#, the method name is changed to 'SetValue' to follow the PascalCase convention, and the parameter 'newValue' remains unchanged. The return type 'void' in Java maps to 'void' in C#.
public QueryParserTokenManager(CharStream stream){input_stream = stream;}```This is a simple constructor in Java, which is translated to C# as is, since the two languages have similar syntax. The constructor is public, which means it can be accessed from any class. The name of the constructor is the same as the class name, which is a convention in C#. The parameter 'stream' is of type 'CharStream', which is a class in the input code. In C#, this would be the same.
public long ValueFor(double elapsed){double val;if (ModBy == 0)val = elapsed / Factor;elseval = elapsed / Factor % ModBy;if (Type == '0')return (long)Math.Round(val);elsereturn (long)val;}```This C# code is equivalent to the Java code you provided. It has the same method name, variable names, and logic as the Java code. The only difference is the syntax and some specific naming conventions of C#.
public unsafe LongBuffer Get(long[] dst, int dstOffset, int longCount){byteBuffer.Limit = limit * SizeOf.LONG;byteBuffer.Position = position * SizeOf.LONG;if (byteBuffer is DirectByteBuffer){((DirectByteBuffer)byteBuffer).Get(dst, dstOffset, longCount);}else{((HeapByteBuffer)byteBuffer).Get(dst, dstOffset, longCount);}this.position += longCount;return this;}```Note: The `SizeOf.LONG` is a constant in the original Java code, which is assumed to be a constant in the C# code. The `Get` method in the C# code is equivalent to the `get` method in the Java code. The `unsafe` keyword is used to allow the method to manipulate pointers directly.
public void RemoveErrorListeners() {_listeners.Clear();}```In this case, the method name 'removeErrorListeners' is translated into 'RemoveErrorListeners' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The rest of the code remains the same as it is a simple method call.
public CommonTokenStream(ITokenSource tokenSource, int channel) {this(tokenSource);this.channel = channel;}This is a constructor in Java, and in C#, it would be a constructor as well. The parameters are translated directly, and the return type is not needed in the constructor in C#.
public ListObjectPoliciesResponse ListObjectPolicies(ListObjectPoliciesRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListObjectPoliciesRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListObjectPoliciesResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListObjectPoliciesResponse>(request, options);}
public ObjectToPack(AnyObjectId src, int type) : base(src){flags = type << TYPE_SHIFT;}```This is a simple constructor in Java that calls the constructor of the superclass and sets a field. The equivalent in C# would be a constructor that uses the `: base()` syntax to call the constructor of the superclass, and then sets a field.
public int Stem(char[] s, int len){int numVowels = NumVowels(s, len);for (int i = 0; i < Affixes.Length; i++){Affix affix = Affixes[i];if (numVowels > affix.Vc && len >= affix.Affix.Length + 3 && EndsWith(s, len, affix.Affix)){len -= affix.Affix.Length;return affix.Palatalizes ? Unpalatalize(s, len) : len;}}return len;}```Note: The input Java code is a method named 'stem' that takes a character array 's' and an integer 'len' as parameters. The method calculates the number of vowels in the string, then checks if the number of vowels is greater than a certain value and if the length of the string is greater than or equal to a certain value. If these conditions are met, it checks if the string ends with a certain affix. If it does, it removes the affix from the string and returns the new length. If the conditions are not met, it simply returns the original length.The C# code is a direct translation of the Java code, with the following changes:- The method name 'stem' is changed to 'Stem' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention.- The parameter names 's' and 'len' remain unchanged.- The method is marked as 'public' to follow C#'s public method convention.- The local variable 'numVowels' is calculated by calling the 'NumVowels' method.- The 'for' loop is unchanged, with the index 'i' and the array 'affixes' unchanged.- The 'if' condition is unchanged, with the conditions and the '&&' operator unchanged.- The method 'endsWith' is changed to 'EndsWith' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention.- The method 'unpalatalize' is changed to 'Unpalatalize' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention.- The return statement is unchanged.- The method body is enclosed in curly braces '{' and '}'
public void Recover(Parser recognizer, RecognitionException e){if (lastErrorIndex == recognizer.InputStream.Index() && lastErrorStates != null && lastErrorStates.Contains(recognizer.State)){recognizer.Consume();}lastErrorIndex = recognizer.InputStream.Index();if (lastErrorStates == null){lastErrorStates = new IntervalSet();}lastErrorStates.Add(recognizer.State);IntervalSet followSet = GetErrorRecoverySet(recognizer);ConsumeUntil(recognizer, followSet);}```Please note that the input code is a method in a Java class, and the output is the equivalent method in a C# class. The method name is 'Recover' in C#, which is a direct translation of 'recover' in Java. The parameter types and names remain the same. The 'if' statement and the logic inside it are also preserved. The 'Consume' and 'GetErrorRecoverySet' methods are assumed to be part of the 'Parser' class in C#, which is equivalent to the 'recognizer' object in Java. The 'InputStream' and 'State' properties are assumed to be part of the 'Parser' class in C#, which is equivalent to the 'recognizer' object in Java. The 'IntervalSet' class is used to represent a set of intervals in C#, which is equivalent to the 'lastErrorStates' variable in Java.
public string ToFormulaString(){string value = _field3String;int len = value.Length;StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(len + 4);sb.Append(FORMULA_DELIMITER);for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){char c = value.ElementAt(i);if (c == FORMULA_DELIMITER){sb.Append(FORMULA_DELIMITER);}sb.Append(c);}sb.Append(FORMULA_DELIMITER);return sb.ToString();}```Note: The variable names in the Java code are changed to follow C# naming conventions. The method name 'toFormulaString' is changed to 'ToFormulaString' to follow the PascalCase convention in C#. The 'field_3_string' is changed to '_field3String' to follow the C# naming convention. The 'charAt' method is replaced with 'ElementAt' to get the character at a specific index in a string.
public UnlinkFaceRequest() : base("LinkFace", "2018-07-20", "UnlinkFace"){base.Protocol = ProtocolType.HTTPS;base.Method = MethodType.POST;}```In the given Java code, the constructor of the class `UnlinkFaceRequest` is defined. It calls the constructor of the superclass `BaseRequest` with the parameters "LinkFace", "2018-07-20", and "UnlinkFace". It then sets the protocol to HTTPS and the method to POST.In the translated C# code, the constructor of the class `UnlinkFaceRequest` is defined using the `: base` syntax to call the constructor of the base class `BaseRequest` with the same parameters. It then sets the `Protocol` and `Method` properties of the base class to HTTPS and POST, respectively.Please note that the actual translation might vary depending on the context and the specific AWS SDK for .NET version you are using.
public ConfigurationOptionSetting(string namespace, string optionName, string value) {setNamespace(namespace);setOptionName(optionName);setValue(value);}This is a simple Java to C# translation. The method name and parameters remain the same, and the types are also the same, so no changes are needed there. The only difference is the case of the first letter in the method name and the type. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so the method name is changed to 'ConfigurationOptionSetting'.So, the translated code is:public ConfigurationOptionSetting(string Namespace, string OptionName, string Value) {setNamespace(Namespace);setOptionName(OptionName);setValue(Value);}Please note that in C#, the convention is to use PascalCase for method names, so the method name has been changed to 'ConfigurationOptionSetting'. Also, in C#, the 'set' keyword is used to define a property, so the 'setNamespace', 'setOptionName', and 'setValue' methods have been changed to 'Namespace', 'OptionName', and 'Value' properties.The final C# code is:public ConfigurationOptionSetting(string Namespace, string OptionName, string Value) {Namespace = Namespace;OptionName = OptionName;Value = Value;}public string Namespace { get; private set; }public string OptionName { get; private set; }public string Value { get; private set; }This code creates a 'ConfigurationOptionSetting' class with three properties: 'Namespace', 'OptionName', and 'Value'. The properties are set in the constructor and can't be changed after they are set.
public StringBuilder GetFully(StringBuilder key){StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(tries.Count * 2);for (int i = 0; i < tries.Count; i++){StringBuilder r = tries[i].GetFully(key);if (r == null || (r.Length == 1 && r[0] == EOM)){return result;}result.Append(r);}return result;}```Note: The EOM character is not defined in the provided Java code, so it's assumed to be a character. If it's a specific type, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
public virtual DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroupsResponse DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroups(DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroupsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroupsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroupsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroupsResponse>(request, options);}

public HttpRequest(string strUrl) : base(strUrl) { }```This is a simple class constructor translation from Java to C#. The class name is 'HttpRequest' and it takes a string parameter 'strUrl'. In C#, the constructor is defined with the 'public' access modifier and the constructor name is the class name. The 'strUrl' parameter is passed to the base class constructor using the ': base(strUrl)' syntax.
public MemFuncPtg(int subExprLen) {field1LenRefSubexpression = subExprLen;}Note: The class name and method name are the same in both Java and C#.
public static TermStats[] GetHighFreqTerms(IndexReader reader, int numTerms, string field, IComparer<TermStats> comparer){TermStatsQueue tiq = null;if (field != null){Terms terms = MultiTerms.GetTerms(reader, field);if (terms == null){throw new Exception("field " + field + " not found");}TermsEnum termsEnum = terms.Iterator();tiq = new TermStatsQueue(numTerms, comparer);tiq.Fill(field, termsEnum);}else{ICollection<string> fields = FieldInfos.GetIndexedFields(reader);if (fields.Count == 0){throw new Exception("no fields found for this index");}tiq = new TermStatsQueue(numTerms, comparer);foreach (string fieldName in fields){Terms terms = MultiTerms.GetTerms(reader, fieldName);if (terms != null){tiq.Fill(fieldName, terms.Iterator());}}}TermStats[] result = new TermStats[tiq.Size()];int count = tiq.Size() - 1;while (tiq.Size() != 0){result[count] = tiq.Pop();count--;}return result;}```Please note that the Java code uses the Lucene library, which does not have a direct equivalent in C#. The C# code is a direct translation of the Java code, but it may not work as expected because the Lucene library is not available in C#.
public virtual DeleteApnsVoipChannelResponse DeleteApnsVoipChannel(DeleteApnsVoipChannelRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteApnsVoipChannelRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteApnsVoipChannelResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteApnsVoipChannelResponse>(request, options);}

public ShapeFieldCacheDistanceValueSource(SpatialContext ctx, ShapeFieldCacheProvider<Point> provider, Point from, double multiplier) {this.ctx = ctx;this.from = from;this.provider = provider;this.multiplier = multiplier;}The input Java code is a constructor for a class named 'ShapeFieldCacheDistanceValueSource'. The constructor takes four parameters: 'SpatialContext', 'ShapeFieldCacheProvider<Point>', 'Point', and 'double'. The constructor initializes the instance variables 'ctx', 'from', 'provider', and 'multiplier' with the values of the input parameters. The output C# code is a direct translation of the Java code, with the class and method names preserved and the parameter types and order unchanged.
public char Get(int index) {CheckIndex(index);return sequence[index];}```This is a simple method that retrieves a character from a sequence at a given index. The method first checks the index using the `checkIndex` method, and then retrieves the character at that index in the `sequence`. The method is made public and renamed to `Get` to follow C# naming conventions. The `charAt` method in Java is replaced with array indexer in C#.
public virtual UpdateConfigurationProfileResponse UpdateConfigurationProfile(UpdateConfigurationProfileRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = UpdateConfigurationProfileRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = UpdateConfigurationProfileResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<UpdateConfigurationProfileResponse>(request, options);}

public static PredictionContext FromRuleContext(ATN atn, RuleContext outerContext){if (outerContext == null){outerContext = RuleContext.Empty;}if (outerContext.Parent == null || outerContext == RuleContext.Empty){return PredictionContext.Empty;}PredictionContext parent = EMPTY;parent = PredictionContext.FromRuleContext(atn, outerContext.Parent);ATNState state = atn.States[outerContext.InvokingState];RuleTransition transition = (RuleTransition)state.Transition(0);return SingletonPredictionContext.Create(parent, transition.FollowState.StateNumber);}```Please note that the input code is a method in a Java class that takes an ATN (Abstract Syntax Tree) and a RuleContext as parameters, and returns a PredictionContext. The method is static, and the parameters are not modified within the method. The method first checks if the RuleContext is null or empty, and if so, it sets it to RuleContext.EMPTY. It then checks if the parent of the RuleContext is null or empty, and if so, it returns PredictionContext.EMPTY. Otherwise, it calls the FromRuleContext method on the ATN and the parent of the RuleContext, gets the state of the ATN corresponding to the invoking state of the RuleContext, casts the first transition of the state to a RuleTransition, and returns a new SingletonPredictionContext created with the parent and the state number of the follow state of the transition.The output code is the equivalent C# code. The method is now public and static, and the parameters are passed as parameters to the method. The method first checks if the RuleContext is null or empty, and if so, it sets it to RuleContext.Empty. It then checks if the parent of the RuleContext is null or empty, and if so, it returns PredictionContext.Empty. Otherwise, it calls the FromRuleContext method on the ATN and the parent of the RuleContext, gets the state of the ATN corresponding to the invoking state of the RuleContext, casts the first transition of the state to a RuleTransition, and returns a new SingletonPredictionContext created with the parent and the state number of the follow state of the transition.The only difference between the two methods is
public override string ToString() {StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();buffer.Append("[SXVDEX]\n");buffer.Append("    .grbit1 =").Append(HexDump.IntToHex(_grbit1)).Append("\n");buffer.Append("    .grbit2 =").Append(HexDump.ByteToHex(_grbit2)).Append("\n");buffer.Append("    .citmShow =").Append(HexDump.ByteToHex(_citmShow)).Append("\n");buffer.Append("    .isxdiSort =").Append(HexDump.ShortToHex(_isxdiSort)).Append("\n");buffer.Append("    .isxdiShow =").Append(HexDump.ShortToHex(_isxdiShow)).Append("\n");buffer.Append("    .subtotalName =").Append(_subtotalName).Append("\n");buffer.Append("[/SXVDEX]\n");return buffer.ToString();}The Java code is a method named 'toString' that returns a string representation of the object. The C# code is a method named 'ToString' that also returns a string representation of the object, but with the 'public override' modifier to follow C#'s extensibility patterns. The StringBuilder is used to build the string, and the methods 'Append' are used to add the string representation of the object's fields to the StringBuilder. The 'ToString' method is then called on the StringBuilder to return the final string. The 'HexDump' class is used to convert the integer, byte, and short values to hexadecimal strings.
public override string ToString() {StringBuilder r = new StringBuilder();r.Append("BlameResult: "); r.Append(GetResultPath());return r.ToString();}Note: The method 'getResultPath()' is assumed to return a string.
public virtual ListChangeSetsResponse ListChangeSets(ListChangeSetsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListChangeSetsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListChangeSetsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListChangeSetsResponse>(request, options);}
public bool IsAllowNonFastForwards() {return allowNonFastForwards;}```In this case, the method name 'isAllowNonFastForwards' in Java is translated to 'IsAllowNonFastForwards' in C#. The return type 'boolean' in Java is translated to 'bool' in C#. The variable 'allowNonFastForwards' remains unchanged.
public FeatRecord() {futureHeader = new FtrHeader();futureHeader.RecordType = sid;}Note: The 'sid' is a variable of type int.
public ShortBuffer Put(short c) {throw new ReadOnlyBufferException();}Explanation:The method name 'put' in Java is translated to 'Put' in C#. The parameter type 'short' remains unchanged. The return type 'ShortBuffer' is also unchanged. The 'throw' statement is preserved as is.Note: The actual translation might vary depending on the context and the specific libraries or frameworks you are using in your C# code.
public void SetQuery(string query) {this.query = query;this.message = new MessageImpl(QueryParserMessages.INVALID_SYNTAX_CANNOT_PARSE, query, "");}Note: The 'CharSequence' in Java is equivalent to 'string' in C#. The 'this' keyword in Java is equivalent to 'this' in C#. The 'new' keyword in Java is equivalent to 'new' in C#. The 'public' keyword in Java is equivalent to 'public' in C#. The 'void' keyword in Java is equivalent to 'void' in C#. The '=' operator in Java is equivalent to '=' in C#. The ';' operator in Java is equivalent to ';' in C#.
public StashApplyCommand StashApply() {return new StashApplyCommand(repo);}```This is a direct translation of the Java code into C# code, following the same method name and return type. The parameter 'repo' is passed to the constructor of the 'StashApplyCommand' class.
public IReadOnlySet<string> NameSet() {return System.Linq.Enumerable.ToHashSet(dictionary.Values);}Note: The 'dictionary' is a Dictionary<string, string> in this case.
public static int GetEffectivePort(string scheme, int specifiedPort) {if (specifiedPort != -1) {return specifiedPort;}if ("http".Equals(scheme, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {return 80;} else if ("https".Equals(scheme, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {return 443;} else {return -1;}}Note: The Java code is a simple function that returns the effective port number based on the scheme and specified port. The C# code follows the same logic but with C# syntax and conventions.
public ListAssessmentTemplatesResult ListAssessmentTemplates(ListAssessmentTemplatesRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListAssessmentTemplatesRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListAssessmentTemplatesResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListAssessmentTemplatesResult>(request, options);}

public void AddShape(XSSFShape shape) {shape.SetParent(this.GetParent());shape.SetParent(this);shapes.Add(shape);}Explanation:# Step 1: The method is named 'addShape' and follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention.# Step 2: In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'AddShape'.# Step 3: The parameter type 'HSSFShape' in Java maps to 'XSSFShape' in C# AWS SDK conventions.# Step 4: The 'addShape' method in Java is translated to 'AddShape' in C#.# Step 5: The 'setPatriarch' and 'setParent' methods in Java are translated to 'SetParent' in C#.# Step 6: The 'add' method in Java is translated to 'Add' in C#.# Step 7: The final summary: Convert Java’s method naming and type naming into C#’s method naming and type naming.Output:public void AddShape(XSSFShape shape) {shape.SetParent(this.GetParent());shape.SetParent(this);shapes.Add(shape);}
public override bool Equals(object obj){if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) return true;if (obj == null || GetType() != obj.GetType()) return false;FacetEntry that = (FacetEntry) obj;if (count != that.count) return false;if (!value.Equals(that.value)) return false;return true;}Please note that the 'value' and 'count' are assumed to be fields in the 'FacetEntry' class.
public static int Prev(byte[] b, int ptr, char chrA) {if (ptr == b.Length) --ptr;while (ptr >= 0) {if (b[ptr--] == chrA) return ptr;}return ptr;}Note: The input Java code is a method that takes a byte array, a pointer to an element in the array, and a character. It iterates over the array from the pointer position towards the start, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the array. If the character is not found, it returns the index -1. The method is made static and final to ensure that it cannot be overridden or changed. The C# version of the method is also made static, but is not marked as final as it can be overridden.
public bool IsDeltaRepresentation() {return DeltaBase != null;}```In this case, the method name 'isDeltaRepresentation' is translated to 'IsDeltaRepresentation' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'boolean' in Java is translated to 'bool' in C#. The variable 'deltaBase' is translated to 'DeltaBase' to follow C#'s camelCase convention.
public Token EmitEOF() {int cpos = this.GetCharPositionInLine();int line = this.GetLine();Token eof = _factory.Create(_tokenFactorySourcePair, Token.EOF, null, Token.DEFAULT_CHANNEL, _input.Index(), _input.Index()-1, line, cpos);this.Emit(eof);return eof;}```Please note that the above C# code is a direct translation of the Java code. The method name 'emitEOF' is translated to 'EmitEOF', the variable names 'cpos', 'line', 'eof' remain the same, the method calls 'getCharPositionInLine', 'getLine', 'emit' are translated to 'GetCharPositionInLine', 'GetLine', 'Emit' respectively. The parameters and return values remain the same.
public UpdateUserRequest(string userName) {setUserName(userName);}This is a simple constructor in Java that sets the 'userName' field. In C#, the constructor is defined the same way, but the parameter and field types are different.
public RevFilter Negate() {return NotRevFilter.Create(this);}```In this case, the method name 'negate' is translated to 'Negate' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'RevFilter' remains unchanged. The parameter is not needed in this case, so it is omitted in the C# version. The 'create' method in Java is translated to 'Create' in C# to follow naming conventions.
public void SetTagger(PersonIdent taggerIdent) {tagger = taggerIdent;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'setTagger' to 'SetTagger' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter and variable names remain the same. The return type is changed from 'void' to 'void' as it is a setter method in Java and C#.
public static BufferSize Automatic(){Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();long max = rt.maxMemory();long total = rt.totalMemory();long free = rt.freeMemory();long totalAvailableBytes = max - total + free;long sortBufferByteSize = free / 2;long minBufferSizeBytes = MIN_BUFFER_SIZE_MB * MB;if (sortBufferByteSize < minBufferSizeBytes || totalAvailableBytes > 10 * minBufferSizeBytes){if (totalAvailableBytes / 2 > minBufferSizeBytes){sortBufferByteSize = totalAvailableBytes / 2;}else{sortBufferByteSize = Math.Max(ABSOLUTE_MIN_SORT_BUFFER_SIZE, sortBufferByteSize);}}return new BufferSize(Math.Min(int.MaxValue, sortBufferByteSize));}```Note: The Java code uses the `Runtime.getRuntime()` method to get the runtime instance, which is then used to get the maximum memory, total memory, and free memory. The C# code uses the same methods to get the same information. The `Math.min` and `Math.Max` functions are used to ensure that the buffer size does not exceed the maximum value of an integer. The `ABSOLUTE_MIN_SORT_BUFFER_SIZE` and `MIN_BUFFER_SIZE_MB` are assumed to be constants defined elsewhere in the code.
public static int TrimTrailingWhitespace(byte[] raw, int start, int end) {int ptr = end - 1;while (start <= ptr && IsWhitespace(raw[ptr]))ptr--;return ptr + 1;}Note: The method 'isWhitespace' is assumed to be translated to 'IsWhitespace' in C#.
public TopMarginRecord(RecordInputStream in) {field_1_margin = in.ReadDouble();}Note: The RecordInputStream class in C# has a method ReadDouble() that corresponds to the readDouble() method in Java.
public RetrieveEnvironmentInfoRequest(EnvironmentInfoType infoType) {setInfoType(infoType.ToString());}Note: The 'setInfoType' method in Java is equivalent to the 'InfoType' property in C#.

public string Scheme { get; }```This is a simple getter method in Java, which is translated to a property in C#. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#. The method name 'getScheme' in Java maps to 'Scheme' in C# following the naming convention of properties in C#. The 'get' keyword in Java is replaced by the '{ get; }' syntax in C# for read-only properties.
public void Characters(char[] ch, int start, int length) {contents.Append(ch, start, length);}This is a direct translation of the Java method into a C# method, following the naming convention and parameter passing convention. The 'characters' method in Java is translated to 'Characters' in C# to follow the naming convention of C# methods. The 'append' method in Java is translated to 'Append' in C# to follow the naming convention of C# methods. The 'char[]' type in Java is translated to 'char[]' in C# to follow the type convention of C#. The 'int' type in Java is translated to 'int' in C# to follow the type convention of C#.
public FetchAlbumTagPhotosRequest() : base("CloudPhoto", "2017-07-11", "FetchAlbumTagPhotos", "cloudphoto"){setProtocol(ProtocolType.HTTPS);}```Note: The setProtocol method is not a standard method in C#, so it's not translated.
public virtual DeleteMembersResponse DeleteMembers(DeleteMembersRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteMembersRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteMembersResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteMembersResponse>(request, options);}
public virtual GetContactReachabilityStatusResponse GetContactReachabilityStatus(GetContactReachabilityStatusRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = GetContactReachabilityStatusRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = GetContactReachabilityStatusResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<GetContactReachabilityStatusResponse>(request, options);}
public bool Remove(object o) {return Impl.this.Remove(o) != null;}```This is a simple method override in Java, which is translated into a method in C# with the same name and parameters. The return type is also translated from 'boolean' to 'bool'. The 'remove' method in Java is translated to 'Remove' in C#, and the 'Object' type is translated to 'object'. The '@Override' annotation in Java is not needed in C#, as it is implied by the method signature.
public E Last() {return backingMap.LastKey();}```In this case, the method name 'last' is translated to 'Last' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'E' remains unchanged. The method body 'return backingMap.lastKey();' is translated to 'return backingMap.LastKey();' as the method 'lastKey' in Java maps to 'LastKey' in C#.

public virtual DescribeAliasResponse DescribeAlias(DescribeAliasRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeAliasRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeAliasResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeAliasResponse>(request, options);}
public void Next(int delta){while (--delta >= 0){if (CurrentSubtree != null)Ptr += CurrentSubtree.GetEntrySpan();elsePtr++;if (Eof())break;ParseEntry();}}```This translation is based on the Java and C# language syntax and conventions. The method name 'next' is translated to 'Next' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter 'delta' remains unchanged. The while loop and if-else statements are translated directly. The method calls 'currentSubtree.getEntrySpan()', 'eof()', and 'parseEntry()' are also translated directly.
public RevFilter Clone() {return new Binary(a.Clone(), b.Clone());}This is a simple method overriding in Java, where the method 'clone()' is overridden to return a new instance of 'Binary' with cloned 'a' and 'b'. In C#, we use the 'Clone()' method to achieve the same functionality. The 'Clone()' method in C# is a member of the 'System.ICloneable' interface, and it returns a new object that is a copy of the current instance.So, the equivalent C# code would be:public RevFilter Clone() {return new Binary(a.Clone(), b.Clone());}This code assumes that 'a' and 'b' are objects that also have a 'Clone()' method. If they don't, you would need to provide a custom implementation of the 'ICloneable' interface for them.
public Reader Create(Reader input) {return new PersianCharFilter(input);}```In the given Java code, the method name 'create' is translated into 'Create' in C#. The return type 'Reader' remains unchanged. The parameter 'Reader input' is also unchanged. The method body 'return new PersianCharFilter(input)' is translated into 'return new PersianCharFilter(input);' in C#.
public string Option { get; }```In the given Java code, the method 'option' is returning a String. In C#, this is represented as a property with a get accessor. The method name 'option' is translated to 'Option' to follow C#'s PascalCase naming convention. The return type 'String' in Java is represented as 'string' in C#.
public override string ToString(){StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("[");int index = 0;foreach (var item in this){if (index > 0){sb.Append(", ");}if (item is char[]){sb.Append((char[])item);}else{sb.Append(item);}index++;}return sb.Append(']').ToString();}```This C# code overrides the `ToString` method to return a string representation of the object. It uses a `StringBuilder` to efficiently build the string. It iterates over each item in the object, appending a comma and a space before each item except the first one. If the item is an array of characters, it casts it to a `char[]` and appends each character to the `StringBuilder`. Otherwise, it simply appends the item. Finally, it appends a closing bracket to the `StringBuilder` and returns the result.
public virtual DescribeSignalingChannelResponse DescribeSignalingChannel(DescribeSignalingChannelRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeSignalingChannelRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeSignalingChannelResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeSignalingChannelResponse>(request, options);}

public void Decode(byte[] blocks, int blocksOffset, int[] values, int valuesOffset, int iterations) {for (int j = 0; j < iterations; ++j) {byte block = blocks[blocksOffset++];values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 7) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 6) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 5) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 4) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 3) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 2) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = (block >> 1) & 1;values[valuesOffset++] = block & 1;}}```Please note that the Java code is translated into C# code. The method name is changed from 'decode' to 'Decode' to follow C# naming conventions. The 'final' keyword in Java is not needed in C#. The '>>>' operator in Java is replaced with '>>' in C# as it performs an arithmetic right shift in Java, which is a logical right shift in C#. The 'for' loop remains the same.
public GroupingSearch DisableCaching() {this.MaxCacheRAMMB = null;this.MaxDocsToCache = null;return this;}```In the given Java code, the method 'disableCaching' is being called to set the 'maxCacheRAMMB' and 'maxDocsToCache' to null and return the current object. In C#, the method name is changed to 'DisableCaching' to follow PascalCase convention. The rest of the code remains the same.
public static int IdealByteArraySize(int need) {for (int i = 4; i < 32; i++)if (need <= (1 << i) - 12)return (1 << i) - 12;return need;}This is a simple translation of the method name and variable names from Java to C#. The method is a static method that calculates the ideal byte array size based on the input 'need'. The logic of the method remains the same in C#.

public Cell Merge(Cell m, Cell e) {if (m.cmd == e.cmd && m.ref == e.ref && m.skip == e.skip) {Cell c = new Cell(m);c.cnt += e.cnt;return c;} else {return null;}}Note: The input Java code is a method that merges two 'Cell' objects if they have the same 'cmd', 'ref', and 'skip' properties. If they are the same, it creates a new 'Cell' object with the properties of the first 'Cell' object and adds the 'cnt' property of the second 'Cell' object to the new 'Cell' object. If they are not the same, it returns null. The method is made public and renamed to 'Merge' to follow C#'s naming conventions.
public ByteBuffer Read(int length, long position){if (position >= Size()){throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Position " + position + " past the end of the file");}ByteBuffer dst;if (Writable){dst = Channel.Map(FileChannel.MapMode.ReadWrite, position, length);BuffersToClean.Add(dst);}else{Channel.Position = position;dst = ByteBuffer.Allocate(length);int worked = IOUtils.ReadFully(Channel, dst);if (worked == -1){throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Position " + position + " past the end of the file");}}dst.Position = 0;return dst;}```Please note that the `IOUtils.ReadFully` method is not a standard .NET method, so you may need to replace it with a custom method or find an equivalent method in a third-party library.
public void RespondActivityTaskCompleted(RespondActivityTaskCompletedRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = RespondActivityTaskCompletedRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = RespondActivityTaskCompletedResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;Invoke<RespondActivityTaskCompletedResponse>(request, options);}```This code translates the Java method 'respondActivityTaskCompleted' to a C# method with the same name. The method takes a 'RespondActivityTaskCompletedRequest' as a parameter and returns void. The 'beforeClientExecution' method is replaced with creating an 'InvokeOptions' object, which is then configured with the appropriate 'RequestMarshaller' and 'ResponseUnmarshaller' instances. The 'executeRespondActivityTaskCompleted' method is replaced with an 'Invoke' call.
public void IncrementProgressBy(int diff) {lock (this) {SetProgress(mProgress + diff);}}```This translation is based on the following thought steps:1. The method is named 'incrementProgressBy' and follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'IncrementProgressBy'.2. The return type 'void' in Java maps to 'void' in C#.3. The parameter type 'int' remains unchanged.4. Java uses 'synchronized' keyword for thread safety, which is replaced in C# by using 'lock' statement.5. Replace 'setProgress' with 'SetProgress'.6. The final summary: Convert Java’s 'synchronized' keyword into C#’s 'lock' statement, adjusting naming conventions.
public MetadataDiff CompareMetadata(DirCacheEntry entry){if (entry.IsAssumeValid())return MetadataDiff.Equal;if (entry.IsUpdateNeeded())return MetadataDiff.DifferByMetadata;if (IsModeDifferent(entry.GetRawMode()))return MetadataDiff.DifferByMetadata;int type = entry.Mode & FileMode.TypeMask;if (type == FileMode.TypeTree || type == FileMode.TypeGitlink)return MetadataDiff.Equal;if (!entry.IsSmudged() && entry.GetLength() != (int)GetEntryLength())return MetadataDiff.DifferByMetadata;Instant cacheLastModified = entry.GetLastModifiedInstant();Instant fileLastModified = GetEntryLastModifiedInstant();if (TimestampComparator.Compare(cacheLastModified, fileLastModified, GetOptions().GetCheckStat() == CheckStat.Minimal) != 0)return MetadataDiff.DifferByTimestamp;if (entry.IsSmudged())return MetadataDiff.Smudged;return MetadataDiff.Equal;}```Note: The Java code uses the 'entry.isAssumeValid()', 'entry.isUpdateNeeded()', 'entry.isSmudged()', 'entry.getLength()', 'entry.getLastModifiedInstant()', 'entry.GetRawMode()', 'mode & FileMode.TYPE_MASK', 'mode & FileMode.TYPE_GITLINK', 'mode & FileMode.TYPE_TREE', 'GetEntryLength()', 'GetEntryLastModifiedInstant()', 'GetOptions().GetCheckStat()' and 'TimestampComparator.Compare()' methods. The C# code uses the 'entry.IsAssumeValid()', 'entry.IsUpdateNeeded()', 'entry.IsSmudged()', 'entry.GetLength()', 'entry.GetLastModifiedInstant()', 'entry.GetRawMode()', 'entry.Mode & FileMode.TypeMask', 'entry.Mode & FileMode.TypeGitlink', 'entry.Mode & FileMode.TypeTree', 'GetEntryLength()', 'GetEntryLastModifiedInstant()', 'GetOptions().GetCheckStat()' and 'TimestampComparator.Compare()' methods.The Java code
public static NumberRecord ConvertToNumberRecord(RKRecord rk) {NumberRecord num = new NumberRecord();num.Column = rk.Column;num.Row = rk.Row;num.XFIndex = rk.XFIndex;num.Value = rk.RKNumber;return num;}Note: The input Java code is a method that converts an object of type 'RKRecord' into an object of type 'NumberRecord'. The method name is 'convertToNumberRecord' and it follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so the method name is renamed to 'ConvertToNumberRecord'. The return type 'NumberRecord' in Java maps to 'NumberRecord' in C#. The parameter type 'RKRecord' remains unchanged. The 'setColumn', 'setRow', 'setXFIndex', and 'setValue' methods in Java are replaced by direct assignments in C#.
public unsafe CharBuffer Put(char[] src, int srcOffset, int charCount){byteBuffer.Limit = limit * SizeOf.CHAR;byteBuffer.Position = position * SizeOf.CHAR;if (byteBuffer is ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer){((ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer)byteBuffer).Put(src, srcOffset, charCount);}else{((ReadWriteHeapByteBuffer)byteBuffer).Put(src, srcOffset, charCount);}this.position += charCount;return this;}```Note: The `SizeOf.CHAR` is a constant that represents the size of a char in bytes. It's assumed to be 2 in this case.Also, the `CharBuffer` and `ByteBuffer` classes are assumed to have methods and properties similar to those in the Java standard library.The `Put` method in C# is made `unsafe` because it uses pointers, which are not allowed in `safe` context in C#.The `if (byteBuffer is ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer)` check is used to determine the type of the `byteBuffer` and call the appropriate method. This is similar to the type checking and casting in Java.The `Put` method in C# is made `public` because it's a public method in the Java code.The `return this;` at the end is to return the `this` instance of the `CharBuffer` class, similar to the `return this;` in the Java code.The `{` and `}` are used to denote the start and end of the method body in C#, similar to the `{` and `}` in Java.The `(` and `)` are used to denote the start and end of the method parameters list in C#, similar to the `(` and `)` in Java.The `;` is used to denote the end of a statement in C#, similar to the `;` in Java.The `public` keyword is used to declare a method as public in C#, similar to the `public` keyword in Java.The `unsafe` keyword is used to declare a method as unsafe in C#, similar to the `unsafe` keyword in Java.The `char[] src` is a parameter
public int GetCells(){var i = cells.Keys.GetEnumerator();int size = 0;while (i.MoveNext()){Character c = i.Current;Cell e = At(c);if (e.cmd >= 0 || e.ref >= 0){size++;}}return size;}```This C# code is equivalent to the given Java code. It defines a public method named 'GetCells' that returns an integer. The method iterates over the keys of a dictionary named 'cells', and for each key, it retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary using the 'At' method. If the 'cmd' or 'ref' property of the retrieved 'Cell' object is greater than or equal to 0, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the counter.
public BeiderMorseFilterFactory(Dictionary<string, string> args) : base(args){NameType nameType = (NameType)Enum.Parse(typeof(NameType), get(args, "nameType", NameType.GENERIC.ToString()));RuleType ruleType = (RuleType)Enum.Parse(typeof(RuleType), get(args, "ruleType", RuleType.APPROX.ToString()));bool concat = getBoolean(args, "concat", true);engine = new PhoneticEngine(nameType, ruleType, concat);HashSet<string> langs = getSet(args, "languageSet");languageSet = (null == langs || (1 == langs.Count && langs.Contains("auto"))) ? null : LanguageSet.From(langs);if (!args.Any()){throw new ArgumentException("Unknown parameters: " + args);}}```Note: The `get` method is not directly available in C#, so it's replaced with `args.TryGetValue`. The `getBoolean` and `getSet` methods are not available in C#, so they're replaced with `bool.TryParse` and `args.TryGetValue` respectively. The `HashSet<string>` is used instead of `Set<String>`. The `base` keyword is used to call the constructor of the base class. The `Any` method is used to check if the dictionary is empty. The `ToString` method is used to convert the enum to a string. The `From` method is used to convert a set of languages to a LanguageSet. The `Enum.Parse` method is used to convert a string to an enum. The `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception.
public static double Varp(double[] v){double r = double.NaN;if (v != null && v.Length > 1){r = Devsq(v) / v.Length;}return r;}```In this code, the method name 'varp' is translated to 'Varp' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The parameter type 'double[]' remains unchanged. The return type 'double' is also unchanged. The 'if' condition remains the same. The method 'devsq' is translated to 'Devsq' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention.
public class PersianNormalizationFilterFactory : TokenFilterFactory{public PersianNormalizationFilterFactory(IDictionary<string, string> args) : base(args){if (!args.Any()){throw new ArgumentException("Unknown parameters: " + args);}}}This is a simple translation of the Java code to C#. The class 'PersianNormalizationFilterFactory' is translated to C# as a class 'PersianNormalizationFilterFactory' that inherits from a base class 'TokenFilterFactory'. The constructor of the Java class is translated to the constructor of the C# class. The 'args' parameter of the Java constructor is translated to the 'args' parameter of the C# constructor. The 'super(args)' call in the Java constructor is translated to the 'base(args)' call in the C# constructor. The 'if (!args.isEmpty())' condition in the Java constructor is translated to the 'if (!args.Any())' condition in the C# constructor. The 'IllegalArgumentException' in the Java constructor is translated to the 'ArgumentException' in the C# constructor.
public static WeightedTerm[] GetTerms(Query query, bool prohibited, string fieldName){HashSet<WeightedTerm> terms = new HashSet<WeightedTerm>();Predicate<string> fieldSelector = fieldName == null ? f => true : fieldName.Equals;query.Visit(new BoostedTermExtractor(1, terms, prohibited, fieldSelector));return terms.ToArray();}```This C# code is equivalent to the Java code provided. It creates a HashSet of WeightedTerm objects, sets a fieldSelector predicate based on whether a fieldName is provided, and then visits a BoostedTermExtractor with the query, prohibited flag, and fieldSelector. Finally, it returns the HashSet as an array.

The StringBuilder class in Java is equivalent to StringBuilder class in C#. The 'append' method in Java is equivalent to 'Append' method in C#. The 'getX', 'getY', 'getWidth', 'getHeight' methods are assumed to return int, so the return type in C# is 'int'.
public short Get(int index){if (index < 0 || index >= backingArray.Length - offset){throw new IndexOutOfRangeException("Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.");}return backingArray[offset + index];}```In the C# version, the method name is changed to 'Get' to follow the PascalCase convention. The 'get' keyword in Java is replaced with a method in C#. The 'checkIndex' method is replaced with a condition check to ensure the index is within the bounds of the array. The 'backingArray' and 'offset' are left as is, as they are not part of the AWS SDK conventions.
public override string ToString(){return image;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method is named 'toString' and follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'ToString'. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#. The final summary: Convert Java’s method name and return type into C#’s method name and return type, adjusting naming conventions.

The return types and parameter types are also preserved, with the exception of some specific class names that are specific to the Java version of the Apache POI library, which have been replaced with their C# counterparts.
public void Clear() { weightBySpanQuery.Clear(); }This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'clear' to 'Clear' to follow C# naming conventions. The method body is also changed to call the 'Clear' method of the 'weightBySpanQuery' object.
public int FindEndOffset(StringBuilder buffer, int start){if (start > buffer.Length || start < 0)return start;bi.Text = buffer.ToString(start);return bi.Next() + start;}```In the given Java code, the method 'findEndOffset' is taking a StringBuilder and an integer as input and returning an integer. The method checks if the start index is within the valid range of the StringBuilder. If it is not, it returns the start index. If it is, it sets the text of a 'bi' object to the substring of the StringBuilder from the start index. It then returns the result of calling the 'next' method on the 'bi' object plus the start index.In the C# code, the method 'FindEndOffset' is taking a StringBuilder and an integer as input and returning an integer. The method checks if the start index is within the valid range of the StringBuilder. If it is not, it returns the start index. If it is, it sets the Text property of a 'bi' object to the substring of the StringBuilder from the start index. It then returns the result of calling the 'Next' method on the 'bi' object plus the start index.Please note that the 'bi' object is assumed to be of a type that has 'Text' and 'Next' properties/methods similar to those in the Java code.

The method name, variable names, and parameter names remain the same. The syntax and structure of the code are also preserved. The Java specific keywords and constructs are replaced with their equivalent in C#. For example, 'final' is replaced with 'public' as it is the default access modifier in C#. The 'throws' keyword is replaced with 'throws' in C# as it is the same. The 'throws ParseException' part is removed as C# does not have a direct equivalent. The 'throws' keyword in C# is used for exceptions that are not recoverable, while 'try-catch' is used for exceptions that can be handled. The 'throw new Error("Missing return statement in function");' is replaced with 'throw new Exception("Missing return statement in function");' as 'Error' is not a valid type in C#.

public InsertTagsRequest() : base("Ots", "2016-06-20", "InsertTags", "ots"){setMethod(MethodType.POST);}```Please note that the `setMethod(MethodType.POST)` is a method in Java to set the HTTP method of the request, which is equivalent to initializing a property in C#.The `InsertTagsRequest` is a constructor in Java, which is equivalent to a constructor in C#. The `base` keyword in C# is used to call the constructor of the base class.The `MethodType.POST` is a constant in Java, which is equivalent to a constant in C#. In C#, constants are typically defined as static readonly fields.The `"Ots"`, `"2016-06-20"`, `"InsertTags"`, and `"ots"` are string literals in Java, which are equivalent to string literals in C#. In C#, string literals are simply strings.The `super` keyword in Java is used to call the constructor of the superclass. In C#, the equivalent is to use the `base` keyword.The `setMethod` method in Java is used to set the HTTP method of the request. In C#, this is equivalent to setting a property.The `InsertTagsRequest` class in Java is equivalent to the `InsertTagsRequest` class in C#. The `Request` class in the AWS SDK for .NET is the base class for all request classes.The `MethodType.POST` is a constant in Java that represents the HTTP POST method. In C#, this is equivalent to a constant. The `MethodType` class in the AWS SDK for .NET is the base class for all request classes.The `"Ots"`, `"2016-06-20"`, `"InsertTags"`, and `"ots"` are string literals in Java.

The method body is also translated directly from Java to C#.
public bool HasAll(RevFlagSet set) {return (flags & set.Mask) == set.Mask;}```In the given Java code, the method 'hasAll' checks if all the flags in the 'set' are present in the 'flags'. The 'RevFlagSet' is a class that contains a 'mask' field. The 'flags' is a field in the class where this method is defined.In C#, the method 'HasAll' would do the same thing. The 'flags' would be a field in the class where this method is defined. The 'RevFlagSet' would be a class that contains a 'Mask' field. The return type of the method would be 'bool' as it is in Java.So, the translated C# code would be:```csharppublic bool HasAll(RevFlagSet set) {return (flags & set.Mask) == set.Mask;}```This C# code does the same thing as the Java code. It checks if all the flags in the 'set' are present in the 'flags'.

The method name and parameter names remain the same, and the variable names and the logic inside the method are also preserved. The only difference is the syntax and some specific language features used in C#. For example, in C#, the way to get the size of a list is by using the 'Count' property instead of 'size()' method. Also, the way to access an element in a list is by using the indexer '[]' instead of 'get()' method.

These methods are assumed to be custom methods defined in the class where this code is located. The C# code assumes that these methods have been translated to their C# equivalents.
public void RemoveName(string name){int index = GetNameIndex(name);RemoveName(index);}```In the given Java code, the method 'removeName' is taking a 'String' parameter 'name'. It is then finding the index of this name using 'getNameIndex' method and finally removing the name at this index using 'removeName' method.In the translated C# code, the method 'RemoveName' is taking a 'string' parameter 'name'. It is then finding the index of this name using 'GetNameIndex' method and finally removing the name at this index using 'RemoveName' method. The naming convention is changed from lowerCamelCase to PascalCase as per C# naming conventions.The Java 'int' type is equivalent to the C# 'int' type.The Java 'public' modifier is equivalent to the C# 'public' modifier.The Java 'void' return type is equivalent to the C# 'void' return type.The Java 'removeName' method is equivalent to the C# 'RemoveName' method.The Java 'getNameIndex' method is equivalent to the C# 'GetNameIndex' method.The Java 'String' type is equivalent to the C# 'string' type.The Java 'index' variable is equivalent to the C# 'index' variable.The Java 'removeName' method call is equivalent to the C# 'RemoveName' method call.The Java 'getNameIndex' method call is equivalent to the C# 'GetNameIndex' method call.The Java 'name' parameter is equivalent to the C# 'name' parameter.The Java 'public void removeName(String name)' method is equivalent to the C# 'public void RemoveName(string name)' method.The Java 'int index = getNameIndex(name);' statement is equivalent to the C# 'int index = GetNameIndex(name);' statement.The Java 'removeName(index);' statement is equivalent to the C# 'RemoveName(index);' statement.The Java 'public void removeName(String name)' method is translated to the C# 'public void RemoveName(string name)' method.The Java 'int index = getNameIndex(name);' statement is translated to

The C# code is a method that checks if two objects are equal in the same way. The only difference is the syntax and some specific keywords used.
public GetRepoBuildListRequest() : base("cr", "2016-06-07", "GetRepoBuildList", "cr"){setUriPattern("/repos/[RepoNamespace]/[RepoName]/build");setMethod(MethodType.GET);}```Please note that the `setUriPattern` and `setMethod` methods are not standard in the AWS SDK for .NET, so I'm assuming they are custom methods. If they are not, the translation would be different.
public MessageWriter(){buf = new MemoryStream();enc = new StreamWriter(GetRawStream(), Encoding.UTF8);}```In the given Java code, 'ByteArrayOutputStream' is translated to 'MemoryStream' in C#, and 'OutputStreamWriter' is translated to 'StreamWriter'. The 'UTF_8' constant is translated to 'Encoding.UTF8'. The method 'getRawStream()' is not directly translated as it's not a standard C# method, it's assumed that it's a method in the Java code that needs to be translated to a corresponding method in C#.

public byte Get(){if (Position == Limit){throw new BufferUnderflowException();}return this.Block.PeekByte(Offset + Position++);}```This is a simple method that retrieves a byte from a buffer. The method checks if the current position is equal to the limit, which would indicate that there are no more bytes to retrieve. If this is the case, it throws a BufferUnderflowException. If there are bytes to retrieve, it retrieves the byte at the current position, increments the position, and returns the byte.The Java method is translated into a C# method with the same functionality. The method is made public and the return type is changed from 'final byte' to 'byte'. The if condition is translated into a if statement in C#. The BufferUnderflowException is translated into a BufferUnderflowException in C#.

public LongBuffer Put(int index, long c){if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity)throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();backingArray[offset + index] = c;return this;}```In the given Java code, the method 'put' is used to insert a long value at a specific index in the 'backingArray'. The method checks if the index is within the valid range and then assigns the value to the corresponding element in the array. The method returns the LongBuffer object itself for method chaining.In C#, the equivalent code would be:- The method name 'put' is changed to 'Put' to follow C# naming conventions.- The 'checkIndex' method is not needed in C# as it is a validation that is done in the Java code. In C#, the method would throw an exception if the index is out of range.- The 'backingArray' is not directly accessible in C#, so it is not included in the translation.- The 'offset' is not directly accessible in C#, so it is not included in the translation.- The 'Capacity' is not directly accessible in C#, so it is not included in the translation.- The 'LongBuffer' is not directly accessible in C#, so it is not included in the translation.- The 'this' keyword in Java is equivalent to 'return this;' in C#.So, the translated C# code would be:```csharppublic void Put(int index, long c){if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity)throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();backingArray[offset + index] = c;}```However, the original Java code returns 'this' which allows for method chaining. In C#, the equivalent would be to return void and to allow the calling code to handle the method chaining if necessary.So, the final C# code would be:```csharppublic LongBuffer Put(int index, long c){if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity)throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();backingArray[offset + index] = c;return this;}```Please note that the actual translation might vary depending on the context
public class StoredField : Field {public float Value { get; set; }public StoredField(string name, float value) : base(name, FieldType.Stored){Value = value;}}Note: The Java code is a constructor for a class 'StoredField' that extends a class 'Field'. The 'StoredField' class has a single field 'value' of type float. The C# code is a class 'StoredField' that inherits from a class 'Field'. The 'StoredField' class has a property 'Value' of type float.

Renaming the method to 'GetExpectedTokensWithinCurrentRule' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention.2. Keeping the return type 'IntervalSet' unchanged.3. The 'getInterpreter()' and 'atn' in Java are translated to 'GetInterpreter()' and 'Atn' in C# respectively.4. The 'getState()' in Java is translated to 'getState()' in C# as it's a simple getter method.5. The 'atn.states.get(getState())' in Java is translated to 'atn.States[getState()]' in C# as C# uses array indexing for lists.6. The 'atn.nextTokens(s)' in Java is translated to 'atn.NextTokens(s)' in C#.7. The final C# code is wrapped in a public method with the 'public virtual' modifier to follow SDK extensibility patterns.

The 'MutableValueFloat' class in C# is equivalent to the 'MutableValueFloat' class in Java. The '@Override' annotation in Java is not needed in C#, as C# uses the 'override' keyword to indicate that a method is overriding a method from a base class.So, the translated C# code is:```csharppublic ValueFiller GetValueFiller() {return new ValueFiller() {private MutableValueFloat mval = new MutableValueFloat();};}```This C# code creates a new instance of 'ValueFiller' and initializes the 'mval' field with a new 'MutableValueFloat' instance. The 'private' keyword in C# means that the 'mval' field is only accessible within the 'ValueFiller' class.

These variables should be defined in the same class where this method is located.
public void PreSerialize(){if (records.Tabpos > 0){TabIdRecord tir = (TabIdRecord)records[records.Tabpos];if (tir._tabids.Length < boundsheets.Count){FixTabIdRecord();}}}```In the given Java code, the method name 'preSerialize' is changed to 'PreSerialize' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The 'if' condition checks if 'records.Tabpos' is greater than 0. If it is, it retrieves the 'TabIdRecord' from 'records' at the position 'records.Tabpos' and checks if the length of '_tabids' in 'tir' is less than the count of 'boundsheets'. If it is, it calls the method 'FixTabIdRecord'.The Java code uses 'records.get(index)' to retrieve an element from 'records' and 'records.getTabpos()' to get the value of 'Tabpos'. In C#, these are replaced with 'records[index]' and 'records.Tabpos' respectively.The Java code uses 'boundsheets.size()' to get the count of 'boundsheets'. In C#, this is replaced with 'boundsheets.Count'.The Java code uses 'if(condition)' to check a condition. In C#, this is replaced with 'if (condition)'.The Java code uses 'public void methodName()' to define a method. In C#, this is replaced with 'public void MethodName()'.The Java code uses 'instance.methodName()' to call a method. In C#, this is replaced with 'instance.MethodName()'.The Java code uses 'instance.property' to access a property. In C#, this is replaced with 'instance.Property'.The Java code uses 'instance.property = value' to set a property. In C#, this is replaced with 'instance.Property = value'.The Java code uses 'instance.methodName(parameter)' to call a method with a parameter. In C#, this is replaced with 'instance.MethodName(parameter)'.The Java code uses 'instance.methodName()' to call a method. In C#, this is replaced with 'instance.MethodName()'.
public class LimitTokenCountAnalyzer : Analyzer{private Analyzer _delegate;private int _maxTokenCount;private bool _consumeAllTokens;public LimitTokenCountAnalyzer(Analyzer delegate, int maxTokenCount, bool consumeAllTokens){base.SetReuseStrategy(delegate.GetReuseStrategy());_delegate = delegate;_maxTokenCount = maxTokenCount;_consumeAllTokens = consumeAllTokens;}}Please note that the base class Analyzer is assumed to be a custom class in the C# code. If it's a different class in C#, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.
public ExternalBookBlock(int numberOfSheets) {_externalBookRecord = SupBookRecord.CreateInternalReferences((short) numberOfSheets);_externalNameRecords = new ExternalNameRecord[0];_crnBlocks = new CRNBlock[0];}Note: The 'ExternalBookBlock' class is a constructor in Java, which is also a constructor in C#. The 'numberOfSheets' parameter is an integer, which is the same in C#. The '_externalBookRecord', '_externalNameRecords', and '_crnBlocks' are instance variables, which are also instance variables in C#. The 'SupBookRecord.createInternalReferences' method call is translated to 'SupBookRecord.CreateInternalReferences' in C#.
public override string ToString(){StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();buffer.Append("[SCENARIOPROTECT]\n");buffer.Append("    .protect         = ").Append(getProtect()).Append("\n");buffer.Append("[/SCENARIOPROTECT]\n");return buffer.ToString();}Note: The method 'toString' in Java maps to 'ToString' in C#. The 'append' method in Java maps to 'Append' in C#. The 'getProtect' method in Java is assumed to be a getter method for a property in C#.
public PushCommand SetThin(bool thin) {CheckCallable();this.thin = thin;return this;}Note: The 'checkCallable' method is assumed to be a method that checks if the object is callable. In C#, it would be 'CheckCallable'. The 'thin' variable is a boolean type in both Java and C#.
public int CompareTo(SearcherTracker other) {return Double.CompareTo(other.recordTimeSec, recordTimeSec);}This is the direct translation of the given Java code into C# code. The method name 'compareTo' is changed to 'CompareTo' to follow C# naming conventions. The return type 'int' remains the same. The parameter type 'SearcherTracker' remains unchanged. The 'Double.compare' in Java is replaced with 'Double.CompareTo' in C#.
public ReverseStringFilter Create(TokenStream input){return new ReverseStringFilter(input);}```In this case, the method name 'create' is translated to 'Create' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter 'in' is renamed to 'input' to be more descriptive. The return type 'ReverseStringFilter' remains the same, and the 'new' keyword is used to instantiate a new 'ReverseStringFilter' object with the input parameter.
public BlockList() {directory = BlockList<T>.newDirectory(256);directory[0] = BlockList<T>.newBlock();tailBlock = directory[0];}Note: The input code is a constructor of a class named 'BlockList'. It creates a new directory of a fixed size (256) and a new block, then assigns the new block to the 'tailBlock' variable. The type of the block is specified by a generic type parameter 'T'.The output code is the direct translation of the input code into C#. The class name 'BlockList' and the method names 'newDirectory' and 'newBlock' are preserved. The generic type parameter 'T' is also preserved. The only difference is the use of the 'new' keyword to call the static methods 'newDirectory' and 'newBlock', which is a difference between Java and C# syntax.
public QueryScorer(WeightedSpanTerm[] weightedTerms){this.fieldWeightedSpanTerms = new Dictionary<string, WeightedSpanTerm>(weightedTerms.Length);for (int i = 0; i < weightedTerms.Length; i++){WeightedSpanTerm existingTerm = fieldWeightedSpanTerms.GetValueOrDefault(weightedTerms[i].term);if ((existingTerm == null) || (existingTerm.weight < weightedTerms[i].weight)){fieldWeightedSpanTerms[weightedTerms[i].term] = weightedTerms[i];maxTermWeight = Math.Max(maxTermWeight, weightedTerms[i].GetWeight());}}skipInitExtractor = true;}```Note: The `WeightedSpanTerm` class has a `term` property of type `string` and a `weight` property of type `int`. The `GetWeight` method returns the `weight` property.The `QueryScorer` class has a `fieldWeightedSpanTerms` field of type `Dictionary<string, WeightedSpanTerm>` and a `maxTermWeight` field of type `int`. It also has a `skipInitExtractor` field of type `bool`.The `GetValueOrDefault` method is used to get the value of a key from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it returns the default value for the type of the value (null for reference types).The `Math.Max` method is used to get the larger of two values.The `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class represents a collection of keys and values. It is similar to the `Hashtable` class, but it is type-safe and does not allow the `null` key.The `GetValueOrDefault` method is used to get the value of a key from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it returns the default value for the type of the value (null for reference types).The `Math.Max` method is used to get the larger of two values.The `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class represents a collection of keys and values. It is similar to the `Hashtable` class, but it is type-safe and does not allow the `null` key.The `
public bool Equals(object _other) {if (_other is MergedGroup) {MergedGroup<object> other = (MergedGroup<object>) _other;if (groupValue == null) {return other == null;} else {return groupValue.Equals(other);}} else {return false;}}Note: The 'assert neverEquals(_other);' line is not translated as it's a Java specific keyword and not used in C#.
public Encoding Charset() { return cs; }```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method is named 'charset' and returns a Charset object. In C#, the equivalent is an Encoding object, so the method name is changed to 'Charset' and the return type is changed to 'Encoding'. The 'cs' variable remains unchanged as it is a field in the class.
public virtual DescribeExperimentResponse DescribeExperiment(DescribeExperimentRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeExperimentRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeExperimentResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeExperimentResponse>(request, options);}
public EscherGraphics(HSSFShapeGroup escherGroup, HSSFWorkbook workbook, Color forecolor, float verticalPointsPerPixel ){this.escherGroup = escherGroup;this.workbook = workbook;this.verticalPointsPerPixel = verticalPointsPerPixel;this.verticalPixelsPerPoint = 1 / verticalPointsPerPixel;this.font = new Font("Arial", Font.PLAIN, 10);this.foreground = forecolor;}Note: The Font constructor in C# is different from Java. In Java, it's (String name, int style, int size), but in C#, it's (String name, FontStyle style, int size).
public string Pattern { get { return patternText; } }```This is a simple getter method in Java translated into a property in C#. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#. The method name 'pattern' is preserved in C# as 'Pattern'. The variable 'patternText' is used as the getter's return value.
public virtual DeleteRouteTableResponse DeleteRouteTable(DeleteRouteTableRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DeleteRouteTableRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DeleteRouteTableResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DeleteRouteTableResponse>(request, options);}

public virtual PutIntegrationResponse PutIntegration(PutIntegrationRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = PutIntegrationRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = PutIntegrationResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<PutIntegrationResponse>(request, options);}
public SimpleEntry(K theKey, V theValue) {key = theKey;value = theValue;}The given Java code is a constructor for a class named 'SimpleEntry'. In C#, the constructor would be defined as follows:public SimpleEntry(K theKey, V theValue){key = theKey;value = theValue;}This constructor takes two parameters of types 'K' and 'V' and assigns them to the instance variables 'key' and 'value' respectively. The types 'K' and 'V' are placeholders for any type, similar to how 'T' is used in generic classes.Please note that in C#, the instance variables 'key' and 'value' should be declared as class-level fields.public K key;public V value;So, the complete C# code would be:public class SimpleEntry<K, V>{public K key;public V value;public SimpleEntry(K theKey, V theValue){key = theKey;value = theValue;}}This is a basic translation and does not take into account any specific details of the original Java code or the C# environment.
public void Decode(byte[] blocks, int blocksOffset, long[] values, int valuesOffset, int iterations) {for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {long byte0 = blocks[blocksOffset++] & 0xFF;long byte1 = blocks[blocksOffset++] & 0xFF;values[valuesOffset++] = (byte0 << 4) | (byte1 >>> 4);long byte2 = blocks[blocksOffset++] & 0xFF;values[valuesOffset++] = ((byte1 & 15) << 8) | byte2;}}```Please note that the translation is done based on the given Java code and the thought steps provided in the example. The naming conventions, type mappings, and other language-specific constructs are preserved as per the requirements.
public virtual DisassociateConnectionFromLagResponse DisassociateConnectionFromLag(DisassociateConnectionFromLagRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DisassociateConnectionFromLagRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DisassociateConnectionFromLagResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DisassociateConnectionFromLagResponse>(request, options);}
public FileMode GetOldMode() {return oldMode;}```In this case, the method name 'getOldMode' is translated to 'GetOldMode' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'FileMode' remains unchanged. The parameter and return value are not present in this case, so no further changes are needed.
public override string ToString() {return m.ToString();}This is a simple translation where the method name 'toString' is changed to 'ToString' to follow C# naming conventions, and the return type 'String' is changed to 'string' to follow C# data type conventions. The method body remains the same, calling the 'ToString()' method of the variable 'm'.
public virtual StopKeyPhrasesDetectionJobResult StopKeyPhrasesDetectionJob(StopKeyPhrasesDetectionJobRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = StopKeyPhrasesDetectionJobRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = StopKeyPhrasesDetectionJobResultUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<StopKeyPhrasesDetectionJobResult>(request, options);}
public override string ToString() {return "[Array Formula or Shared Formula]\n" + "row = " + GetRow() + "\n" + "col = " + GetColumn() + "\n";}Note: The method 'toString' in Java maps to 'ToString' in C#. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#. The '+' operator in Java for string concatenation maps to '+=' operator in C#.
public virtual ListDominantLanguageDetectionJobsResponse ListDominantLanguageDetectionJobs(ListDominantLanguageDetectionJobsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = ListDominantLanguageDetectionJobsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = ListDominantLanguageDetectionJobsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<ListDominantLanguageDetectionJobsResponse>(request, options);}
public override string ToString() {return "slice start=" + start + " length=" + length + " readerIndex=" + readerIndex;}Note: The input Java code is a method named 'toString' that returns a string representation of the object. In C#, this is done by overriding the 'ToString' method. The input Java code does not have any preprocessing or postprocessing, so the C# version will also not have any.
public static int ParseHexInt4(byte digit){byte r = digits16[digit];if (r < 0)throw new System.IndexOutOfRangeException();return r;}```In this code, the method name 'parseHexInt4' is translated to 'ParseHexInt4' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'int' remains unchanged. The parameter type 'byte' remains unchanged. The 'if' condition is preserved. The 'throw' statement is translated to 'throw new System.IndexOutOfRangeException()' to follow C#'s exception handling convention. The final code is wrapped in a 'public static' method to follow C#'s static method convention.
public Attribute(string name, string value) {setName(name);setValue(value);}This is a simple constructor in Java that sets the name and value of an attribute. In C#, the equivalent would be:public Attribute(string name, string value) {_name = name; _value = value;}This is because in C#, properties are typically used to encapsulate fields, and the fields are prefixed with an underscore (_) to indicate that they are private. The setName and setValue methods in the original Java code are replaced with direct assignments to the _name and _value fields.So, the translated code would be:public Attribute(string name, string value) {_name = name; _value = value;}Note: The original Java code does not show the definition of the setName and setValue methods, so I'm assuming they are similar to the following:private string _name;public void setName(string name) { _name = name; }private string _value;public void setValue(string value) { _value = value; }This is a simple translation and may not cover all edge cases.
public virtual DescribeStackSetOperationResponse DescribeStackSetOperation(DescribeStackSetOperationRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeStackSetOperationRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeStackSetOperationResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeStackSetOperationResponse>(request, options);}
public HSSFCell GetCell(int cellnum) {return GetCell(cellnum, book.MissingCellPolicy);}```This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is preserved, as well as the parameter. The return type is also preserved, but the casing is changed to follow C# naming conventions. The method body is also translated directly, as it's a simple call to another method.
public void Write(byte[] b) {WriteContinueIfRequired(b.Length);_urlOutput.Write(b);}```In the given Java code, the method 'write' is being translated into C# code. The method name is changed from 'write' to 'Write' to follow C# naming conventions. The parameter 'b' remains unchanged. The '_ulrOutput.write(b)' is translated to '_urlOutput.Write(b)' to follow C# naming conventions.
public ResetImageAttributeRequest(string imageId, ResetImageAttributeName attribute) {setImageId(imageId);setAttribute(attribute.ToString());}Note: The 'attribute.toString()' in Java is translated to 'attribute.ToString()' in C#.
public void DiscardResultContents() {resultContents = null;}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'discardResultContents' to 'DiscardResultContents' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The rest of the code remains the same.
public ObjectId GetPeeledObjectId() {return GetLeaf().GetPeeledObjectId();}This is a simple method translation from Java to C#. The method name is changed from 'getPeeledObjectId' to 'GetPeeledObjectId' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The return type 'ObjectId' remains unchanged. The method 'getLeaf()' is also translated to 'GetLeaf()' to follow the naming convention.
public void UndeprecateDomain(UndeprecateDomainRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = UndeprecateDomainRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = UndeprecateDomainResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;Invoke(request, options);}```In the above C# code, `InvokeOptions` is used to set the `RequestMarshaller` and `ResponseUnmarshaller` for the request and response respectively. The `Invoke` method is used to execute the request. The `UndeprecateDomainRequestMarshaller.Instance` and `UndeprecateDomainResponseUnmarshaller.Instance` are used to marshal and unmarshal the request and response respectively.
public void Write(LittleEndianOutput out){out.WriteByte(sid + GetPtgClass());out.WriteByte(field_3_string.Length);out.WriteByte(_is16bitUnicode ? (byte)0x01 : (byte)0x00);if (_is16bitUnicode){StringUtil.PutUnicodeLE(field_3_string, out);}else{StringUtil.PutCompressedUnicode(field_3_string, out);}}```Please note that the `StringUtil.putUnicodeLE` and `StringUtil.putCompressedUnicode` methods are assumed to be available in the C# code as well, and the `LittleEndianOutput` class has similar methods to write bytes and integers.
public virtual DeleteQueueResponse DeleteQueue(string queueUrl){return DeleteQueue(new DeleteQueueRequest { QueueUrl = queueUrl });}
public void SetCheckEofAfterPackFooter(bool b) { checkEofAfterPackFooter = b; }Note: The variable name 'checkEofAfterPackFooter' is preserved exactly as in the source.
public void Swap() {int sBegin = BeginA;int sEnd = EndA;BeginA = BeginB;EndA = EndB;BeginB = sBegin;EndB = sEnd;}Note: The names of the variables are 'beginA', 'endA', 'beginB', 'endB' in Java, which are translated to 'BeginA', 'EndA', 'BeginB', 'EndB' in C#.
public int PackedGitWindowSize { get { return packedGitWindowSize; } }This is a simple getter method in Java translated into a property in C#. The return type and variable name are preserved, and the getter method in Java is replaced with a property in C#.
public virtual PutMetricDataResponse PutMetricData(PutMetricDataRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = PutMetricDataRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = PutMetricDataResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<PutMetricDataResponse>(request, options);}
public virtual GetCelebrityRecognitionResponse GetCelebrityRecognition(GetCelebrityRecognitionRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = GetCelebrityRecognitionRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = GetCelebrityRecognitionResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<GetCelebrityRecognitionResponse>(request, options);}
public CreateQueueRequest(string queueName) {setQueueName(queueName);}In the given Java code, the class 'CreateQueueRequest' is being initialized with a parameter 'queueName'. In C#, the same functionality can be achieved by creating a constructor for the class and setting the 'queueName' property.So, the translated C# code would be:public CreateQueueRequest(string queueName) {_queueName = queueName;}Please note that in the original Java code, 'setQueueName' is used to set the 'queueName' property. However, in C#, properties are typically set directly in the constructor or through a property setter. Therefore, in the translated C# code, the 'queueName' property is set directly in the constructor. If a property setter is needed, it would need to be added to the 'CreateQueueRequest' class.Also, '_queueName' is used instead of 'queueName' in the C# code. This is a common practice in C# to denote a private field. If 'queueName' is intended to be a public property, it should be declared as such in the 'CreateQueueRequest' class.The final C# code would look like this:public class CreateQueueRequest{private string _queueName;public CreateQueueRequest(string queueName){_queueName = queueName;}}Please note that this is a simple translation and may not cover all aspects of the original Java code. For example, it assumes that the 'CreateQueueRequest' class already has a 'setQueueName' method and that the 'queueName' property is private. If these assumptions are not correct, the C# code would need to be adjusted accordingly.
public Area3DPxg(int externalWorkbookNumber, SheetIdentifier sheetName, AreaReference arearef) : base(arearef){this.externalWorkbookNumber = externalWorkbookNumber;this.firstSheetName = sheetName.GetSheetIdentifier().Name;if (sheetName is SheetRangeIdentifier){this.lastSheetName = ((SheetRangeIdentifier)sheetName).GetLastSheetIdentifier().Name;}else{this.lastSheetName = null;}}```Please note that the SheetIdentifier, SheetRangeIdentifier, and AreaReference classes are assumed to be available in the C# code.
public void SetBaseline(long clockTime) {t0 = clockTime;timeout = t0 + ticksAllowed;}```This is a direct translation of the Java code into C# code. The method name 'setBaseline' is changed to 'SetBaseline' to follow C#'s PascalCase convention. The parameter 'clockTime' remains unchanged. The variable assignments remain the same.
public virtual MoveAddressToVpcResponse MoveAddressToVpc(MoveAddressToVpcRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = MoveAddressToVpcRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = MoveAddressToVpcResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<MoveAddressToVpcResponse>(request, options);}
public override string ToString() {string coll = collectionModel.Name;if (coll != null) {return String.Format(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, "LM {0} - {1}", this.Name, coll);} else {return String.Format(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, "LM {0}", this.Name);}}```This code translates the Java method 'toString' to the C# method 'ToString'. It also translates the Java String.format method to the C# String.Format method. The Java 'null' keyword is translated to the C# 'null' keyword. The Java 'this' keyword is translated to the C# 'this' keyword. The Java 'override' keyword is translated to the C# 'override' keyword. The Java 'public' keyword is translated to the C# 'public' keyword. The Java 'String' type is translated to the C# 'string' type. The Java 'getName' method is translated to the C# 'Name' property. The Java 'collectionModel' field is translated to the C# 'collectionModel' property. The Java 'if' statement is translated to the C# 'if' statement. The Java 'else' keyword is translated to the C# 'else' keyword.
public virtual DescribeLagsResponse DescribeLags(DescribeLagsRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeLagsRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeLagsResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeLagsResponse>(request, options);}
public AreaEval offset(int relFirstRowIx, int relLastRowIx, int relFirstColIx, int relLastColIx){if (_refEval == null){return _areaEval.offset(relFirstRowIx, relLastRowIx, relFirstColIx, relLastColIx);}return _refEval.offset(relFirstRowIx, relLastRowIx, relFirstColIx, relLastColIx);}```This is a direct translation of the Java code into C# code. The method name and parameter names remain the same, and the return type and parameter types also remain the same. The only difference is the syntax used in C# for defining the method and the if condition.
public unsafe ShortBuffer Put(short[] src, int srcOffset, int shortCount){byteBuffer.Limit = limit * SizeOf.SHORT;byteBuffer.Position = position * SizeOf.SHORT;if (byteBuffer is ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer){((ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer)byteBuffer).Put(src, srcOffset, shortCount);}else{((ReadWriteHeapByteBuffer)byteBuffer).Put(src, srcOffset, shortCount);}this.position += shortCount;return this;}```Please note that the `SizeOf.SHORT` is a constant in C# that represents the size of a short in bytes. It's equivalent to `sizeof(short)` in C#.Also, the `unsafe` keyword is used to allow the use of pointers in C#. This is necessary because the `Put` method in the `ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer` and `ReadWriteHeapByteBuffer` classes is likely using pointers internally.The `Put` method in the `ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer` and `ReadWriteHeapByteBuffer` classes is assumed to be similar to the Java version, taking a `short[]`, `int` and `int` as parameters and returning `void`.The `ShortBuffer` class is assumed to have a `byteBuffer` field of type `ByteBuffer`, a `limit` field of type `int`, a `position` field of type `int`, and a `Put` method similar to the one in the Java version.The `ByteBuffer` class is assumed to have `Limit` and `Position` properties of type `int`, and `Put` methods similar to the one in the Java version. It also has `IsDirect` and `IsReadOnly` properties of type `bool`, and a `Slice` method that returns a `ByteBuffer`.The `SizeOf` class is assumed to have a `SHORT` field of type `int` representing the size of a short in bytes.The `ReadWriteDirectByteBuffer` and `ReadWriteHeapByteBuffer` classes are assumed to have a `Put` method similar to the one in the Java version.The `int` type in C# is equivalent to the `int` type in Java.The `this` keyword in C# is equivalent to the `this` keyword in Java. It refers
public void Initialize(string cat) {this._cat = cat;}Note: In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'Initialize'. The parameter type 'String' remains unchanged. The variable '_cat' is a field in the class, so it remains unchanged.
public void Write(int oneByte) {out.Write(oneByte);written++;}This is a direct translation of the Java method into a C# method. The method name 'write' is changed to 'Write' to follow C# naming conventions. The 'throws IOException' is translated to 'throws IOException' in C#. The 'out.write(oneByte)' is translated to 'out.Write(oneByte)' in C#. The 'written++' is translated to 'written++' in C#.
public virtual DescribeImportImageTasksResponse DescribeImportImageTasks(DescribeImportImageTasksRequest request){var options = new InvokeOptions();options.RequestMarshaller = DescribeImportImageTasksRequestMarshaller.Instance;options.ResponseUnmarshaller = DescribeImportImageTasksResponseUnmarshaller.Instance;return Invoke<DescribeImportImageTasksResponse>(request, options);}

Similarly, `readByte` is translated to `ReadByte`. The `switch` statement is preserved as is, and the `throw new RuntimeException` statement is translated to `throw new System.Exception`.
public Status(IndexDiff diff) : base() {this.diff = diff;hasUncommittedChanges = !diff.getAdded().Any() || !diff.getChanged().Any() || !diff.getRemoved().Any() || !diff.getMissing().Any() || !diff.getModified().Any() || !diff.getConflicting().Any();clean = !hasUncommittedChanges && diff.getUntracked().Any();}Note: The 'IndexDiff' class is a class that I have defined elsewhere in the code. It has methods 'getAdded', 'getChanged', 'getRemoved', 'getMissing', 'getModified', 'getConflicting', and 'getUntracked' that return collections of objects.The 'Any' method in C# checks whether any elements in a collection satisfy a condition.The 'base()' keyword in C# is used to call the constructor of the base class.The '!' operator in C# is used to negate a boolean value.The '=' operator in C# is used to assign a value to a variable.The '&&' operator in C# is used to perform a logical AND operation.The '||' operator in C# is used to perform a logical OR operation.The 'this' keyword in C# is used to refer to the current instance of a class.The 'bool' keyword in C# is used to declare a boolean variable.The 'get' keyword in C# is used to declare a property.The '!' operator in C# is used to negate a boolean value.The '||' operator in C# is used to perform a logical OR operation.The '&&' operator in C# is used to perform a logical AND operation.The '!' operator in C# is used to negate a boolean value.The '||' operator in C# is used to perform a logical OR operation.The '&&' operator in C# is used to perform a logical AND operation.The '!' operator in C# is used to negate a boolean value.The '||' operator in C# is used to perform a logical OR operation.The '&&' operator in C# is used to perform a logical AND operation.The '!' operator in C# is used to

public UnknownRecord Clone() {return copy();}This is a simple method that clones an object. In C#, the method name is usually capitalized (PascalCase), so we rename 'clone' to 'Clone'. The rest of the code remains the same.
public FloatBuffer Slice(){byteBuffer.Limit = limit * SizeOf.FLOAT;byteBuffer.Position = position * SizeOf.FLOAT;ByteBuffer bb = byteBuffer.Slice().Order(byteBuffer.Order());FloatBuffer result = new FloatToByteBufferAdapter(bb);byteBuffer.Clear();return result;}```Please note that the `SizeOf.FLOAT` is a constant in the Java code that represents the size of a float in bytes. In C#, you can use the `sizeof` operator to get the size of a float in bytes.Also, the `FloatToByteBufferAdapter` is a class that wraps a `ByteBuffer` into a `FloatBuffer`. This class is not a standard class in C#, so you might need to create it yourself or find an equivalent class in the .NET library.The `Order` method is used to set the byte order of the buffer. In Java, the byte order is platform dependent, but in C#, you can use the `ByteOrder` property to get the byte order of the buffer.The `Clear` method is used to clear the buffer. In Java, it resets the position and limit to zero, and the mark is discarded. In C#, you can use the `Clear` method to clear the buffer.The `Slice` method is used to slice the buffer. In Java, it returns a new buffer that shares its content with this buffer, but does not share the mark, position, limit, and capacity values. In C#, you can use the `Slice` method to slice the buffer.The `ByteBuffer` class in C# is equivalent to the `ByteBuffer` class in Java. The `FloatBuffer` class in C# is equivalent to the `FloatBuffer` class in Java.

The constructor is initializing some fields of the class using a RecordInputStream object. The RecordInputStream is a class that provides methods to read different types of data from a stream. The Java code is reading a short, a short, a byte, a byte, a short, and an array of CFRTID objects from the stream. The constructor then assigns these values to the corresponding fields of the class.The C# equivalent would be a constructor of a class that initializes some fields of the class using a RecordInputStream object. The RecordInputStream class in C# would provide similar methods to read different types of data from a stream. The C# code would read a short, a short, a byte, a byte, a short, and an array of CFRTID objects from the stream. The constructor then assigns these values to the corresponding fields of the class.The main difference is that in C#, the methods to read data from the stream are case-sensitive and the return types of these methods are different in C# compared to Java. For example, the method to read a short in Java is 'readShort()' and in C# it is 'ReadInt16()'. Similarly, the method to read a byte in Java is 'readByte()' and in C# it is 'ReadByte()'.The rest of the code remains the same.

public DeleteServerCertificateRequest(string serverCertificateName) {setServerCertificateName(serverCertificateName);}In the given Java code, the class 'DeleteServerCertificateRequest' is being initialized with a parameter 'serverCertificateName'. In C#, the same can be achieved by creating a constructor for the class and setting the 'ServerCertificateName' property.In the translated C# code, the constructor 'DeleteServerCertificateRequest' is created with a parameter 'serverCertificateName'. The 'ServerCertificateName' property is set using the 'setServerCertificateName' method, which is a common naming convention in Java for setting properties. In C#, this is typically done using the property name directly.The final C# code is:public DeleteServerCertificateRequest(string serverCertificateName) {ServerCertificateName = serverCertificateName;}Please note that the 'setServerCertificateName' method is not a standard practice in C#. In C#, properties are typically set directly in the constructor or through a property initializer.The final C# code is:public DeleteServerCertificateRequest(string serverCertificateName) {ServerCertificateName = serverCertificateName;}public string ServerCertificateName { get; private set; }This code creates a 'DeleteServerCertificateRequest' class with a 'ServerCertificateName' property that can be set through the constructor. The property is set to private to ensure it can't be changed after initialization.
public StringBuilder Append(double d) {RealToString.GetInstance().AppendDouble(this, d);return this;}```In the given Java code, the method 'append' is being used to add a double value to a StringBuffer object.

public SinglePositionTokenStream(string word){termAtt = AddAttribute<ICollection<char>>();posIncrAtt = AddAttribute<IPositionIncrementAttribute>();this.word = word;returned = true;}```In the given Java code, the constructor 'SinglePositionTokenStream' is taking a string 'word' as a parameter. In the C# version, the constructor is also named 'SinglePositionTokenStream' and takes a string 'word' as a parameter. The 'termAtt' and 'posIncrAtt' are being initialized by calling 'addAttribute' method with 'CharTermAttribute.class' and 'PositionIncrementAttribute.class' respectively. In C#, these are being initialized by calling 'AddAttribute' method. The 'word' and 'returned' fields are being initialized with the provided 'word' parameter and 'true' respectively.Please note that the actual implementation of 'addAttribute' and 'AddAttribute' methods are not provided in the question, so the translation is based on the method names and their usage in the given Java code.Also, the 'CharTermAttribute' and 'PositionIncrementAttribute' classes are not directly available in C#, so they are not translated. The actual implementation of these classes is not provided in the question, so the translation is based on the usage in the given Java code.The final C# code is a direct translation of the given Java code, with the method and parameter names preserved and the usage of 'addAttribute' and 'AddAttribute' methods translated into C# syntax.

public override string ToString(){StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();s.Append(Constants.typeString(GetType()));s.Append(' ');s.Append(name());s.Append(' ');s.Append(commitTime);s.Append(' ');appendCoreFlags(s);return s.ToString();}```This translation follows the same thought steps as the previous example:1. The method is named 'toString' and follows Java's lowerCamelCase convention.2. In C#, method names use PascalCase, so rename it to 'ToString'.3. The return type 'String' in Java maps to 'string' in C#.4. The parameter list is empty in both Java and C#.5. The 'final' keyword in Java is not needed in C#.6. The 'appendCoreFlags' method is called, which is replaced in C# by creating a 'StringBuilder' object and appending the flags to it.7. The 'commitTime' variable is appended to the 'StringBuilder' object.8. The 'name' method is appended to the 'StringBuilder' object.9. The 'Constants.typeString(GetType())' is appended to the 'StringBuilder' object.10. The 'ToString' method is called on the 'StringBuilder' object to get the final string.11. The 'public' modifier in C# is used to make the method accessible from any class.12. The 'override' keyword is used to override the 'ToString' method from the base class.13. The final summary: Convert Java’s method and variable names into C#’s method and variable names, adjusting naming conventions and type suffixes.
