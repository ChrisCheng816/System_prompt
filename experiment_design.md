All system prompts adhere to Role Definition + Task Specification + Style and Format Constraints.

## Rules
1. Based on the results of the code translation, we optimized the output according to the data findings. For instance, despite our repeated requests to output only the translated code, the results often included substantial amounts of natural language text. We removed these NL text.

## Results for translation
1. In code translation tasks, retrieval-based system prompts outperform naive-based and cot-based prompts.
2. For structural tasks, cot performance is often worse to naive.
3.
